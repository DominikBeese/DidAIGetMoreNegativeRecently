The machine uses a dictionary and grammar rules, to produce the output. Most importantly, it does not use world knowledge to interpret (or disambiguate), as it is an error prone task and involves guessing or inferring based on knowledge other than the text. Anusaaraka aims for perfect \"information preservation\". We relax the requirement that the output be grammatical. In fact, anusaaraka output follows the grammar of the source language (where the grammar rules differ, and cannot be applied with 100 percent confidence). This requires that the reader undergo a short training to read and understand the output.",

This new QBTE approach liberates QA systems from the heavy burden imposed by question types (or answer types). In conventional approaches, a QA system analyzes a given question and determines the question type, and then it selects answers from among answer candidates that match the question type. Consequently, the output of a QA system is restricted by the design of the question types. The QBTE directly extracts answers as terms biased by the question. To confirm the feasibility of our QBTE approach, we conducted experiments on the CRL QA Data based on 10-fold cross validation, using Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs) as an ML technique. Experimental results showed that the trained system achieved 0.36 in MRR and 0.47 in Top5 accuracy.",

We use two modes of evaluation: one that relies on comparison with a control sentence, paralleling practice in human studies; another that measures probability drop in the disambiguating region of the sentence. Both are surprisingly good indicators of the processing difficulty of garden-path sentences. The sentences tested are drawn from published sources and systematically explore five different types of ambiguity: previous studies have been narrower in scope and smaller in scale. We do not deny the limitations of finite-state models, but argue that our results show that their usefulness has been underestimated.",

  "year": 2007,
  "venue": "ACL",
  "abstract": "Partition-based morphology is an approach of finite-state morphology where a grammar describes a special kind of regular relations, which split all the strings of a given tuple into the same number of substrings. They are compiled in finite-state machines. In this paper, we address the question of merging grammars using different partitionings into a single finite-state machine. A morphological description may then be obtained by parallel or sequential application of constraints expressed on different partition notions (e.g. morpheme, phoneme, grapheme). The theory of Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages, a well known semantics of parallel systems, provides a way of representing and compiling such a description. 1 Partition-Based Morphology Finite-State Morphology is based on the idea that regular relations are an appropriate formalism to describe the morphology of a natural language. Such a relation is a set of pairs, the first component being an actual form called surface form, the second component being an abstract description of this form called lexical form. It is usually implemented by a finitestate transducer. Relations are not oriented, so the same transducer may be used both for analysis and generation. They may be non-deterministic, when the same form belongs to several pairs. Furthermore, finite state machines have interesting properties, they are composable and efficient. There are two main trends in Finite-State Morphology: rewrite-rule systems and two-level rule systems. Rewrite-rule systems describe the morphology of languages using contextual rewrite rules which are easily applied in cascade. Rules are compiled into finite-state transducers and merged using transducer composition (Kaplan and Kay, 1994). The other important trend of Finite-State Morphology is Two-Level Morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983). In this approach, not only pairs of lexical and surface strings are related, but there is a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols. It means that the two strings of a given pair must have the same length. Whenever a symbol of one side does not have an actual counterpart in the other string, a special symbol 0 is inserted at the relevant position in order to fulfill the same-length constraint. For example, the correspondence between the surface form spies and the morpheme concatenation spy+s is given as follows: s p y 0 + s s p i e 0 s Same-length relations are closed under intersection, so two-level grammars describe a system as the simultaneous application of local constraints. A third approach, Partition-Based Morphology, consists in splitting the strings of a pair into the same number of substrings. The same-length constraint does not hold on symbols but on substrings. For example, spies and spy+s may be partitioned as follows: s p y + s s p ie s The partition-based approach was first proposed by (Black et al., 1987) and further improved by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993) and (Grimley-Evans et al.,",

  "abstract": "The lack of Chinese sentiment corpora limits the research progress on Chinese sentiment classification. However, there are many freely available English sentiment corpora on the Web. This paper focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification by using the English corpus as training data. Machine translation services are used for eliminating the language gap between the training set and test set, and English features and Chinese features are considered as two independent views of the classification problem. We propose a cotraining approach to making use of unlabeled Chinese data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can outperform the standard inductive classifiers and the transductive classifiers.",

  "abstract": "A number of approaches to Automatic MT Evaluation based on deep linguistic knowledge have been suggested. However, n-gram based metrics are still today the dominant approach. The main reason is that the advantages of employing deeper linguistic information have not been clarified yet. In this work, we propose a novel approach for meta-evaluation of MT evaluation metrics, since correlation cofficient against human judges do not reveal details about the advantages and disadvantages of particular metrics. We then use this approach to investigate the benefits of introducing linguistic features into evaluation metrics. Overall, our experiments show that (i) both lexical and linguistic metrics present complementary advantages and (ii) combining both kinds of metrics yields the most robust metaevaluation performance.",

  "abstract": "Broad-coverage annotated treebanks necessary to train parsers do not exist for many resource-poor languages. The wide availability of parallel text and accurate parsers in English has opened up the possibility of grammar induction through partial transfer across bitext. We consider generative and discriminative models for dependency grammar induction that use word-level alignments and a source language parser (English) to constrain the space of possible target trees. Unlike previous approaches, our framework does not require full projected parses, allowing partial, approximate transfer through linear expectation constraints on the space of distributions over trees. We consider several types of constraints that range from generic dependency conservation to language-specific annotation rules for auxiliary verb analysis. We evaluate our approach on Bulgarian and Spanish CoNLL shared task data and show that we consistently outperform unsupervised methods and can outperform supervised learning for limited training data.",

We analyze systems that we developed, identifying specific problems in language processing and MT that cause errors. The best cross-lingual 5W system was still 19% worse than the best monolingual 5W system, which shows that MT significantly degrades sentence-level understanding.

We present a simple yet effective strategy that transfers knowledge from a differently annotated corpus to the corpus with desired annotation. We test the efficacy of this method in the context of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging, where no segmentation and POS tagging standards are widely accepted due to the lack of morphology in Chinese. Experiments show that adaptation from the much larger People’s Daily corpus to the smaller but more popular Penn Chinese Treebank results in significant improvements in both segmentation and tagging accuracies (with error reductions of 30.2% and 14%, respectively), which in turn helps improve Chinese parsing accuracy.",

We augment a statistical classifier with an integer linear program imposing hard linguistic constraints on the solution space output by the classifier, capturing global distributional restrictions.

Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in coreference resolution, we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolution systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference resolution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics.

To build a sentiment classifier for a language with no labeled resources, one can translate labeled data from another language, then train a classifier on the translated text. This can be viewed as a domain adaptation problem, where labeled translations and test data have some mismatch. Various prior work have achieved positive results using this approach. In this opinion piece, we take a step back and make some general statements about crosslingual adaptation problems. First, we claim that domain mismatch is not caused by MT errors, and accuracy degradation will occur even in the case of perfect MT. Second, we argue that the cross-lingual adaptation problem is qualitatively different from other (monolingual) adaptation problems in NLP; thus new adaptation algorithms ought to be considered.

We conduct a series of studies comparing human-written model summaries to system summaries at the semantic level of caseframes. We show that model summaries (1) are more abstractive and make use of more sentence aggregation, (2) do not contain as many topical caseframes as system summaries, and (3) cannot be reconstructed solely from the source text, but can be if texts from in-domain documents are added. These results suggest that substantial improvements are unlikely to result from better optimizing centrality-based criteria, but rather more domain knowledge is needed.",

  "abstract": "What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? Although in recent competitions, some of the judging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). The example does not use actual system output. rank system translation 1 bbn “He does not go.” 2 (tie) uedin “He goes not.” 2 (tie) jhu “He did not go.” 4 cmu “He go not.” 5 kit “He not go.” Table 1: WMT elicits preferences by asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” source text sys1 sys2 judge preference “Il ne va pas.” bbn cmu jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” bbn jhu jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” bbn kit jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” bbn uedin jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” cmu jhu jdoe 2 “Il ne va pas.” cmu kit jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” cmu uedin jdoe 2 “Il ne va pas.” jhu kit jdoe 1 “Il ne va pas.” jhu uedin jdoe 0 “Il ne va pas.” kit uedin jdoe 2 Table 2: Pairwise comparisons encoded by Table 1.

We present two concrete use cases involving key techniques in the NLP domain for which we show that reproducing results is still difficult. We show that the deviation that can be found in reproduction efforts leads to questions about how our results should be interpreted. Moreover, investigating these deviations provides new insights and a deeper understanding of the examined techniques. We identify five aspects that can influence the outcomes of experiments that are typically not addressed in research papers. Our use cases show that these aspects may change the answer to research questions leading us to conclude that more care should be taken in interpreting our results and more research involving systematic testing of methods is required in our field.",

However, by using an SVM ranker to combine the realizer’s model score together with features from multiple parsers, including ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes, we show that significant increases in BLEU scores can be achieved. Moreover, via a targeted manual analysis, we demonstrate that the SVM reranker frequently manages to avoid vicious ambiguities, while its ranking errors tend to affect fluency much more often than adequacy.",

Our results show that generally Q-learning fails to converge whereas PHC and PHC-WoLF always converge and perform similarly. We also show that very high gradually decreasing exploration rates are required for convergence. We conclude that multiagent RL of dialogue policies is a promising alternative to using single-agent RL and SUs or learning directly from corpora.",

A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly.

Previous interfaces for searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries.

What these previews should look like is an open question that we explored with a 400-participant Mechanical Turk experiment. We found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than a baseline of naming the relations alone. This suggests that user interfaces should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose between different relations.",

Despite small gains on extremely small supervised training sets, we find that extra information from embeddings appears to make little or no difference to a parser with adequate training data.

This is the highest performance seen so far on this dataset. Surprisingly at the first glance, unlike what was suggested in most previous work, where relatedness statistics learned from corpora is claimed to yield extra gains over lexicon-based models, we obtained our best result relying solely on lexical resources (Roget’s and WordNet)—corpora statistics did not lead to further improvement.

Machine comprehension evaluates the system’s ability to understand text through a series of question-answering tasks on short pieces of text such that the correct answer can be found only in the given text. For this task, we posit that there is a hidden (latent) structure that explains the relation between the question, correct answer, and text. We call this the answer-entailing structure; given the structure, the correctness of the answer is evident. Since the structure is latent, it must be inferred. We present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs), and uses what it learns to answer machine comprehension questions on novel texts. We extend this framework to incorporate multi-task learning on the different subtasks that are required to perform machine comprehension. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that our framework outperforms various IR and neuralnetwork baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 67.8% (vs. 59.9%, the best previously-published result.)",

We build on the work by Mitchell et al. (2010) and show that the semantic prediction model suggested there can successfully predict spoken word durations in naturalistic conversational data. An interesting finding is that the training data for the semantic model also plays a strong role: the model trained on indomain data, even though a better language model for our data, is not able to predict word durations, while the out-ofdomain trained language model does predict word durations. We argue that this at first counter-intuitive result is due to the out-of-domain model better matching the “language models” of the speakers in our data.",

In this paper we quantify and disentangle the impact of genre and topic differences on translation quality by introducing a new data set that has controlled topic and genre distributions. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis showing that differences across topics only explain to a limited degree translation performance differences across genres, and that genre-specific errors are more attributable to model coverage than to suboptimal scoring of translation candidates.",

We employ four state-of-the-art DMs as sources of feature representation for this task, and show that they all yield poor results when tested on attributive properties, achieving no more than an average F-score of 0.37 in the binary property prediction task, compared to 0.73 on taxonomic properties.

NBT models reason over pre-trained word vectors, learning to compose them into distributed representations of user utterances and dialogue context.

Furthermore, due to the limitations of automatic metrics on evaluating story quality, reinforcement learning methods with hand-crafted rewards also face difficulties in gaining an overall performance boost. Therefore, we propose an Adversarial REward Learning (AREL) framework to learn an implicit reward function from human demonstrations, and then optimize policy search with the learned reward function. Though automatic evaluation indicates slight performance boost over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in cloning expert behaviors, human evaluation shows that our approach achieves significant improvement in generating more human-like stories than SOTA systems.",

DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question-answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie - one from Wikipedia and the other from IMDb - written by two different authors. We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language understanding and incorporating external background knowledge. Additionally, the narrative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive passages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we observe that state-of-the-art neural RC models which have achieved near human performance on the SQuAD dataset, even when coupled with traditional NLP techniques to address the challenges presented in DuoRC exhibit very poor performance (F1 score of 37.42% on DuoRC v/s 86% on SQuAD dataset).

In three cross-modal benchmarks we learn a large number of language-to-vision and vision-to-language neural network mappings (up to five layers) using a rich diversity of image and text features and loss functions. Our results reveal that, surprisingly, the neighborhood structure of the predicted vectors consistently resembles more that of the input vectors than that of the target vectors.

  "abstract": "It is standard practice in speech & language technology to rank systems according to their performance on a test set held out for evaluation. However, few researchers apply statistical tests to determine whether differences in performance are likely to arise by chance, and few examine the stability of system ranking across multiple training-testing splits. We conduct replication and reproduction experiments with nine part-of-speech taggers published between 2000 and 2018, each of which claimed state-of-the-art performance on a widely-used \"standard split\". While we replicate results on the standard split, we fail to reliably reproduce some rankings when we repeat this analysis with randomly generated training-testing splits. We argue that randomly generated splits should be used in system evaluation.",

  "abstract": "It has been previously noted that neural machine translation (NMT) is very sensitive to domain shift. In this paper, we argue that this is a dual effect of the highly lexicalized nature of NMT, resulting in failure for sentences with large numbers of unknown words, and lack of supervision for domain-specific words. To remedy this problem, we propose an unsupervised adaptation method which fine-tunes a pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model using a pseudo-in-domain corpus. Specifically, we perform lexicon induction to extract an in-domain lexicon, and construct a pseudo-parallel in-domain corpus by performing word-for-word back-translation of monolingual in-domain target sentences. In five domains over twenty pairwise adaptation settings and two model architectures, our method achieves consistent improvements without using any in-domain parallel sentences, improving up to 14 BLEU over unadapted models, and up to 2 BLEU over strong back-translation baselines.",

  "abstract": "A machine learning system can score well on a given test set by relying on heuristics that are effective for frequent example types but break down in more challenging cases. We study this issue within natural language inference (NLI), the task of determining whether one sentence entails another. We hypothesize that statistical NLI models may adopt three fallible syntactic heuristics: the lexical overlap heuristic, the subsequence heuristic, and the constituent heuristic. To determine whether models have adopted these heuristics, we introduce a controlled evaluation set called HANS (Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems), which contains many examples where the heuristics fail. We find that models trained on MNLI, including BERT, a state-of-the-art model, perform very poorly on HANS, suggesting that they have indeed adopted these heuristics. We conclude that there is substantial room for improvement in NLI systems, and that the HANS dataset can motivate and measure progress in this area.",

They also presented evidence that ED models demonstrate humanlike performance in a nonce-word task. Here, we look more closely at the behaviour of their model in this task. We find that (1) the model exhibits instability across multiple simulations in terms of its correlation with human data, and (2) even when results are aggregated across simulations (treating each simulation as an individual human participant), the fit to the human data is not strong-worse than an older rule-based model. These findings hold up through several alternative training regimes and evaluation measures. Although other neural architectures might do better, we conclude that there is still insufficient evidence to claim that neural nets are a good cognitive model for this task.",

Inferring speaker commitment (aka event factuality) is crucial for information extraction and question answering. Here, we explore the hypothesis that linguistic deficits drive the error patterns of existing speaker commitment models by analyzing the linguistic correlates of model error on a challenging naturalistic dataset. We evaluate two state-of-the-art speaker commitment models on the CommitmentBank, an English dataset of naturally occurring discourses. The CommitmentBank is annotated with speaker commitment towards the content of the complement (\"Florence is packed with visitors\" in our example) of clause-embedding verbs (\"know\", \"think\") under four entailment-canceling environments (negation, modal, question, conditional). A breakdown of items by linguistic features reveals asymmetrical error patterns: while the models achieve good performance on some classes (e.g., negation), they fail to generalize to the diverse linguistic constructions (e.g., conditionals) in natural language, highlighting directions for improvement.",

Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (>95% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (<48%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so as to present ever-harder challenges.",

While several authors have questioned the underlying isomorphism assumption, which states that word embeddings in different languages have approximately the same structure, it is not clear whether this is an inherent limitation of mapping approaches or a more general issue when learning cross-lingual embeddings. So as to answer this question, we experiment with parallel corpora, which allows us to compare offline mapping to an extension of skip-gram that jointly learns both embedding spaces. We observe that, under these ideal conditions, joint learning yields to more isomorphic embeddings, is less sensitive to hubness, and obtains stronger results in bilingual lexicon induction. We thus conclude that current mapping methods do have strong limitations, calling for further research to jointly learn cross-lingual embeddings with a weaker cross-lingual signal.",

We find substantial differences in syntactic generalization performance by model architecture, with sequential models underperforming other architectures. Factorially manipulating model architecture and training dataset size (1M-40M words), we find that variability in syntactic generalization performance is substantially greater by architecture than by dataset size for the corpora tested in our experiments.

Kirov and Cotterell (2018) argue that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the regular past tense form /-(e)d/ to novel words. However, their work does not address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995): that neural models may learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class - and thus fail on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like /-s/ can still be productively generalized. To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior, appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class generalization.",

We compare model performance in English and Spanish to show that non-linguistic biases in RNN LMs advantageously overlap with syntactic structure in English but not Spanish. Thus, English models may appear to acquire human-like syntactic preferences, while models trained on Spanish fail to acquire comparable human-like preferences.

Our results on selectional preference and WordNet datasets show that the centroid-based model will fail to achieve good enough performance, the geometry of the distribution and the existence of subgroups will have limited impact, and also the negative instances need to be considered for adequate modeling of the distribution. We further investigated the relationship between the scores calculated by each model and the degree of membership and found that discriminative learning-based models are best in finding the boundaries of a class, while models based on the offset between positive and negative instances perform best in determining the degree of membership.",

Despite these varied range of possible text alterations, current models for automatic sentence simplification are evaluated using datasets that are focused on a single transformation, such as lexical paraphrasing or splitting. This makes it impossible to understand the ability of simplification models in more realistic settings. To alleviate this limitation, this paper introduces ASSET, a new dataset for assessing sentence simplification in English. ASSET is a crowdsourced multi-reference corpus where each simplification was produced by executing several rewriting transformations. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that simplifications in ASSET are better at capturing characteristics of simplicity when compared to other standard evaluation datasets for the task. Furthermore, we motivate the need for developing better methods for automatic evaluation using ASSET, since we show that current popular metrics may not be suitable when multiple simplification transformations are performed.",

Consequently, we introduce simple and fully general methods for converting from contextualized representations to static lookup-table embeddings which we apply to 5 popular pretrained models and 9 sets of pretrained weights. Our analysis of the resulting static embeddings notably reveals that pooling over many contexts significantly improves representational quality under intrinsic evaluation. Complementary to analyzing representational quality, we consider social biases encoded in pretrained representations with respect to gender, race/ethnicity, and religion and find that bias is encoded disparately across pretrained models and internal layers even for models with the same training data. Concerningly, we find dramatic inconsistencies between social bias estimators for word embeddings.",

This paradigm consists of three stages: (1) pre-training of a word prediction model on a corpus of arbitrary size; (2) fine-tuning (transfer learning) on a training set representing a classification task; (3) evaluation on a test set drawn from the same distribution as that training set. This paradigm favors simple, low-bias architectures, which, first, can be scaled to process vast amounts of data, and second, can capture the fine-grained statistical properties of a particular data set, regardless of whether those properties are likely to generalize to examples of the task outside the data set. This contrasts with humans, who learn language from several orders of magnitude less data than the systems favored by this evaluation paradigm, and generalize to new tasks in a consistent way. We advocate for supplementing or replacing PAID with paradigms that reward architectures that generalize as quickly and robustly as humans.",

  "abstract": "While pretrained models such as BERT have shown large gains across natural language understanding tasks, their performance can be improved by further training the model on a data-rich intermediate task, before fine-tuning it on a target task. However, it is still poorly understood when and why intermediate-task training is beneficial for a given target task. To investigate this, we perform a large-scale study on the pretrained RoBERTa model with 110 intermediate-target task combinations. We further evaluate all trained models with 25 probing tasks meant to reveal the specific skills that drive transfer. We observe that intermediate tasks requiring high-level inference and reasoning abilities tend to work best. We also observe that target task performance is strongly correlated with higher-level abilities such as coreference resolution. However, we fail to observe more granular correlations between probing and target task performance, highlighting the need for further work on broad-coverage probing benchmarks. We also observe evidence that the forgetting of knowledge learned during pretraining may limit our analysis, highlighting the need for further work on transfer learning methods in these settings.",

We further find that these papers' proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating \"bias\" are poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage with the relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing \"bias\" in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of \"bias\"---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements-and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.",

  "venue": "ACL",
  "abstract": "Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that \"we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,\" most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker - that \"women (candidates) are less qualified.\" Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.",

However, prior work implicitly assumed that the structure of the network modules, describing the abstract reasoning process, provides a faithful explanation of the model's reasoning; that is, that all modules perform their intended behaviour. In this work, we propose and conduct a systematic evaluation of the intermediate outputs of NMNs on NLVR2 and DROP, two datasets which require composing multiple reasoning steps. We find that the intermediate outputs differ from the expected output, illustrating that the network structure does not provide a faithful explanation of model behaviour. To remedy that, we train the model with auxiliary supervision and propose particular choices for module architecture that yield much better faithfulness, at a minimal cost to accuracy.",

We critically examine RefCOCOg, a standard benchmark for this task, using a human study and show that 83.7% of test instances do not require reasoning on linguistic structure, i.e., words are enough to identify the target object, the word order doesn't matter. To measure the true progress of existing models, we split the test set into two sets, one which requires reasoning on linguistic structure and the other which doesn't. Additionally, we create an out-of-distribution dataset Ref-Adv by asking crowdworkers to perturb in-domain examples such that the target object changes. Using these datasets, we empirically show that existing methods fail to exploit linguistic structure and are 12% to 23% lower in performance than the established progress for this task.

We suggest a novel task aiming to alleviate some of these concerns - that of detecting articles that most effectively counter the arguments - and not just the stance - made in a given text. We study this problem in the context of debate speeches. Given such a speech, we aim to identify, from among a set of speeches on the same topic and with an opposing stance, the ones that directly counter it. We provide a large dataset of 3,685 such speeches (in English), annotated for this relation, which hopefully would be of general interest to the NLP community.

Second, we both expand a standard English-centered evaluation dictionary collection to include all language pairs using triangulation, and create new dictionaries for under-represented languages. Evaluating established methods over all these language pairs sheds light into their suitability for aligning embeddings from distant languages and presents new challenges for the field. Finally, in our analysis we identify general guidelines for strong cross-lingual embedding baselines, that extend to language pairs that do not include English.",

  "abstract": "Natural language inference (NLI) is an increasingly important task for natural language understanding, which requires one to infer whether a sentence entails another. However, the ability of NLI models to make pragmatic inferences remains understudied. We create an IMPlicature and PRESupposition diagnostic dataset (IMPPRES), consisting of 32K semi-automatically generated sentence pairs illustrating well-studied pragmatic inference types. We use IMPPRES to evaluate whether BERT, InferSent, and BOW NLI models trained on MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) learn to make pragmatic inferences. Although MultiNLI appears to contain very few pairs illustrating these inference types, we find that BERT learns to draw pragmatic inferences. It reliably treats scalar implicatures triggered by \"some\" as entailments. For some presupposition triggers like \"only\", BERT reliably recognizes the presupposition as an entailment, even when the trigger is embedded under an entailment canceling operator like negation. BOW and InferSent show weaker evidence of pragmatic reasoning. We conclude that NLI training encourages models to learn some, but not all, pragmatic inferences.",

  "year": 2000,
  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "The idea for this special issue came up during the preparations of the International Workshop on Finite-State Methods in Natural Language Processing, that was held at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey in the summer of 1998. The number of the submissions had exceeded our initial expectations and we were able to select quite a good set of papers from those submitted. Further, the workshop and the preceding tutorial by Kenneth Beesley, on finite-state methods, was attended by quite a large number of participants. This led us to believe that interest in the theory and applications of finitestate machinery was alive and well, and that some of the papers from this workshop along with further additional submissions could make a very good special issue for this journal. The five papers in this issue are the result of this process. The last decade has seen a quite a substantial surge in the use of finite-state methods in all aspects of natural language applications. Fueled by the theoretical contributions of Kaplan and Kay (1994), Mohri's recent contributions on the use of finite-state techniques in various NLP problems (Mohri 1996, 1997), the success of finite-state approaches especially in computational morphology, for example, Koskenniemi (1983), Karttunen (1983), and Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen (1992), and, finally, the availability of state-of-the-art tools for building and manipulating large-scale finite-state systems (Karttunen 1993; Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen et al. 1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1998; van Noord 1999), recent years have seen many successful applications of finite-state approaches in tagging, spell checking, information extraction, parsing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech applications. This is a remarkable comeback considering that in the dawn of modern linguistics (Chomsky 1957), finitestate grammars were dismissed as fundamentally inadequate. As a result, most of the work in computational linguistics in the past few decades has been focused on far more powerful formalisms. Recent publications on finite-state technology include two collections of papers (Roche and Schabes 1997; Kornai 1999) with contributions covering a wide range of these topics. This special issue, we hope, will add to these contributions. The five papers in this collection cover many aspects of finite-state theory and applications. The papers Treatment of Epsilon Moves in Subset Construction by van Noord and Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata and Transducers by Daciuk, Watson, Watson, and Mihov, address two fundamental aspects in the construction of finite-state recognizers. Van Noord presents results for various methods for producing a deterministic automaton with no epsilon transitions from a nondeterministic automaton with a large number of epsilon transitions, especially those resulting from finite-state approximations of context-free and more powerful formalisms.

In principle, more data might imply more power. At the same time, more data also entails the risk of more noise. At least for our af data, enlarging the complement leads to worse performance. When we allow any sentence that contains af in our analyses, F decreases f rom 0.31 to 0.23 for G 2. When we base the analyses on the complete newspaper corpus, F reduces further to 0.19. The reason for this decrease in performance is probably due to the W/C-ratio being very low for all practical w indow sizes, i.e., at the very left part of the saw-tooth-shaped pat tern characterizing Nsig as a function of W/C. Consequently, any low-frequency word is singled out as a significant i tem wheneve r it occurs at least once in the window. Given the Zipfian structure of word-f requency distributions, a great ma ny spurious low-frequency words are extracted. As ment ioned in the introduction, the received wisdom is that the windowing method is unreliable for events with a f requency of less than 5. By means of an analysis of the behavior of statistical tests for 2 x 2 contingency tables wi th sparse data, a me thod for opt imizing the use of these tests has been developed.

  "abstract": "Natural language generation (NLG) systems are sometimes partitioned into applicationdependent systems which lack a proper theoretical foundation, on the one hand, and theoretically well-founded systems which embody generic linguistic insights, on the other. Template-based systems are often regarded as automatically falling into the first category. We argue against this view. First, we describe the received view of both template-based and ‘‘standard’’ NLG systems (section 2). Then we describe a class of recent template-based systems (section 3) that will serve as a basis for a comparison between template-based and other NLG systems with respect to their potential for performing NLG tasks (section 4). We ask what the real difference between templatebased and other systems is and argue that the distinction between the two is becoming increasingly blurred (section 5). Finally, we discuss the implications of engineering shortcuts (Mellish 2000) and corpus-based methods (section 6).",

  "year": 2006,
  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "If you were to say “Women are numerous,” you would not wish to imply that any particular woman is numerous. Instead, you would probably mean something like “The class of women contains numerous instances.” To say, on the other hand, “Rosa Parks is numerous,” would be nonsense. Whereas the noun woman denotes a class, the proper noun Rosa Parks is an instance of that class. As Quirk et al. (1985, page 288) point out, proper nouns normally lack number contrast. This important distinction between classes and instances underlies the present discussion of WordNet nouns. Some nouns are understood to refer to classes; membership in those classes determines the semantic relation of hyponymy that is basic for the organization of nouns in WordNet (WN). Other nouns, however, are understood to refer to particular individuals. In many cases the distinction is clear, but not always. The distinction to be discussed here is between words ordinarily understood as referring to classes and words ordinarily understood as referring to particular individuals and places. In the literature on knowledge representation, the classic discussion of this distinction is provided by Woods (1975). The distinction was not drawn in initial versions of WN (Miller 1990; Fellbaum 1998), which used the “is a” relation in both cases. That is to say, both “A heroine is a woman” and “Rosa Parks is a woman” were considered to be occurrences of the “is a” relation and were encoded in the WN database in the same manner. Requests to incorporate a distinction between classes and instances have come from ontologists, among others. In their discussion of WN, for example, Gangemi et al. (2001) and Oltramari et al. (2002) complain about the confusion between individuals and concepts. They suggest that if there was an “instance of” relation, they could distinguish between a concept-to-concept relation of subsumption and an individual-to-concept relation of instantiation. That is, essentially, the suggestion we follow in the present work, but in some cases the distinction was not easy to draw. Incorporating this distinction was resisted at first because WN was not initially conceived as an ontology, but rather as a description of lexical knowledge. WN includes verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in addition to nouns. Although no ontology was intended, the organization of nouns in WN bore many similarities to an ontology. As the importance of ontology became more apparent, requests to convert the WN noun hierarchy could no longer be ignored. Version 2.1 of WN takes a step in that direction: the Tops file is reorganized to have a single unique beginner: entity. In a reasonable ontology, however, all terms might be expected to conform to the membership relation of set theory and would not contain individuals or placenames. The confounding of classes and instances in WN posed a problem. The obvious way to solve",

  "abstract": "Intensional logic (IL) and its application to natural language, which the present monograph addresses, was first developed by Richard Montague in the late 1960s (e.g., Montague 1970a, 1970b). Through the efforts of (especially) Barbara Partee (e.g., Partee 1975, 1976), and Richmond Thomason, who edited the posthumous collection of Montague’s works (Thomason 1974), this became the main framework for those who aspired to a formal semantic theory for natural language, and these included computational linguists as early as Jerry Hobbs in the late 1970s (e.g., Hobbs and Rosenschein 1977). In fact, until the advent of the current interest in statistical linguistics with its own conception of what semantics is, IL, or some variant of it, was perhaps the main theory of semantics within computational linguistics generally. And within current computational semantics it still is. But over the years, philosophers, linguists, and computational linguists have noted a variety of shortcomings in Montague’s version of IL. Montague defined intensions as functions from possible worlds to extensions in that world. But this had the effect of making logically equivalent expressions have the same intension, thus leading to the problem of “logical omniscience” (believing/knowing all the logical consequences of what is believed/known). Montague had based his IL on Church’s simple theory of types (Church 1940), supplemented with intensions of each type. But this implies that each natural language item accepts only arguments of some one fixed type. However, this is not true for natural language, where conjunctions, verbs, and pretty much any functional term that accepts arguments at all can accept arguments of different types. (For example, and can accept arguments that are of the sentence type, of the verb phrase type, of the adjective type, etc.; and indeed, it can accept arguments of differing types in its different argument places.) Much study has gone into techniques for changing types of arguments so as to accommodate this phenomenon. One result of this has been to make the semantic structure of all complex items be binary—a consequence that seems otherwise to be without justification. And finally, Montague’s version of IL is higher order, allowing quantification over entities and functions of any level. This results in the system not having a recursively enumerable set of theorems, and there has always been a desire to have a more restricted system for representing natural language. The present monograph addresses all these problematic issues. It develops a fine-grained account of intensions from which an account of a first-order property theory is extracted. A “polymorphic” type structure is developed and the resulting system is claimed “to permit us to achieve expressive power comparable to a higher-order system like IL while remaining within the formal limits of a firstorder system.” Although there are many quite difficult concepts introduced in this monograph, in the main it is very clearly written. If the claims made by the authors for their new intensional language are borne out by further research, then this is a very important addition to the literature on the foundations of semantics for natural language.—Francis Jeffry Pelletier, Simon Fraser University",

  "abstract": "Spoken dialogue systems have received increased interest because they are potentially much more natural and powerful methods of communicating with machines than are current graphics-based interfaces. Wired for Speech presents basic research in the psychological and sociological aspects of voice synthesis and recognition. Its major lesson is that people attribute human characteristics to spoken dialogue systems for reasons related to human evolution. But although it contains interesting basic research, the book is mainly aimed at giving technological or marketing advice to those seeking to use voice interfaces when creating commercial applications. The book is oriented around a series of simple experiments designed to show just how pervasive psychological and social influences can be on the opinions and behaviors of people confronted with voice interfaces. Each chapter describes a basic research hypothesis, introduces an experiment to test it, and discusses its implications for designing voice interfaces: gender, personality, accent, ethnicity, emotion, number of distinct voices, use of “I” by the system, voices in concert with faces, mixed synthetic and recorded voices, context, and the effects of errors in human–computer cooperation. Although Wired for Speech is very accessible, especially to the non-scientist, it is written with an unusual bibliography style for an academic book: All references and details are given in a notes section at the end of the book, making up one third of the content. This narrative exposition style will probably not satisfy either type of reader: Scientists will be frustrated at the imprecision in argumentation, lack of detail in the book itself, and continually having to refer to the notes. The lack of detail also prevents the book from serving as a reference work. Meanwhile those needing advice when implementing voice interfaces will be puzzled at references to Chomsky, Grice, and Zemlin. Thus the book seems to suffer from not knowing its audience well, which is odd as this is precisely the lesson that the book tries to impart. Another complaint from the scientific point of view is the obsession this particular book has with casting every experimental result as advice for the business and marketing side of voice interfaces, typically concentrating on Web-based e-marketing examples such as buying books on line. Most of the experiments have sample sizes of between 40 and 50, but the authors seem ready to invite multibillion-dollar businesses to immediately base their deployed systems on these results. Finally, and fundamentally, this book represents research on psychology and sociology, and the impact of these approaches on the interactions between people and machines. It contains very little linguistic content (for instance, text-to-speech system (TTSs) are described only in terms of their ability to modify pitch, pitch range, volume, etc.) and some of the linguistic detail is wrong, such as the discussion on dialects in the chapter on accent, race, and ethnicity, as well as lexical alignment. Wired for Speech may hold a strong place in the literature on practical advice for human– computer interaction, but computational linguistics readers should get this book only if they want to do research on implementations of spoken dialogue systems and be aware of potential complications when designing experiments that will use such systems.— Charles Callaway, University of Edinburgh [M.

  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "The interest in machine-learning methods to solve natural-language-understanding problems has led to the use of textual annotation as an important auxiliary technique. Grammar induction based on annotation has been very successful for the Penn Treebank, where a corpus of English text was annotated with syntactic information. This shining example has inspired a plethora of annotation efforts: corpora are annotated for ‘coreference’, for animacy, for expressions of opinions, for temporal dependencies, for the estimated duration of the activities that the expressions refer to, and so on. It is not clear though that these efforts are bound to repeat the success of the Penn Treebank. The circumstances in which the Penn Treebank project was executed are vastly different from those in which most annotation tasks take place. First, the annotation was a linguistic task and one about which there is reasonable agreement. People might quibble about the way to represent certain constituent structure distinctions in English, but they do, in general, not disagree about the distinctions themselves; and if you don’t like the Treebank as is, you can translate it into your favorite format. Second, the work was done by advanced students who understood the task and were supervised by specialists in the field. Third, this was not done in a hurry. The project started in 1989 and the corpora are still maintained and the annotations improved. About the only thing that this project has in common with the bulk of annotation tasks is that the annotators were not very well paid. Currently, we see annotation schemas being developed for phenomena that are much less well understood than constituent structure. In workshops and conferences we hear lively discussions about interannotator agreement, about tools to make the annotation task easier, about how to cope with multiple annotations of the same text, about the development of international standards for annotation schemes in specific subdomains, and, most importantly, about the statistical models that can be built once the annotations are in place. One thing that is much less discussed is whether the annotation indeed helps isolate the property that motivated it in the first place. This is not the same as interannotator agreement. For interannotator agreement, it suffices that all annotators do the same thing. But even with full annotator agreement it is not sure that the task captures what was initially intended. Assume that I want to mark all the entities in a text that refer to the same entity with the same number and I tell my annotators “Whenever you see the word Chicago, give it the same number”: I’ll get great interannotator agreement with that guideline but it is debatable whether I will realize my proclaimed aim of classifying references to one and the same entity in the outside world. Presumably, I would like to catch all the references to the city of Chicago, but Chicago pizza is made and sold all over the United States, and the relation",

The book is composed of two quite different parts. Part I (roughly half of the book) defines computational linguistics as a field. Part II presents a clear introduction to computational morphology, primarily using examples from Russian. In addition to basal concepts, this part presents a history of morphological analysis systems for Russian; various implementation options for practical systems; an inventory of phenomena that, although important for descriptive and theoretical morphology, have traditionally been less important in computational applications; and ongoing areas of research. The final chapter argues that a core, general-purpose model for Russian morphology is needed, and that its development should be largely driven by linguistic research. In the Afterword, the author emphasizes his belief that approaching computational morphology as “a linguistic, not a technical discipline” is the most “fruitful” approach, because the real object of research is language, not computer systems (p. 131).

  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "Three times a year I get my copy of a wholly respectable mainstream linguistics journal. Its scholarly articles are rich in examples from varied languages, and alongside these detailed analyses it advances theoretical claims and counterclaims. Its many reviews point to much more of the same. But this journal content is of interest here for another reason than these scholarly ones. First, references to computing are conspicuous by their absence. Just occasionally, grammar types or semantic models appear that have computational connections, for example in a shared view of feature sets; and there are references to computational corpus analysis, though more often in reviews than in major articles. Very very occasionally, there are articles that are more manifestly computational ones, for instance in applying unification to syntactic structures. But in general, the notion that computation in a serious sense, not just as some highly abstract grounding or, maybe, politically correct meta-reference, has something important to say to linguistics never figures. Does this matter? Specifically, whether it matters to the linguists or not, does it matter to us (computational types)? In a world of proliferating specialist journals and, increasingly, conference proceedings, why worry about the lack of computational reference in mainstream linguistics journals? Being computational is not the only way of being legitimate in any field, but there are plenty of publishing venues for the computational. So it need not be a criticism of a linguistics journal like the one I get that it does not have more on computational linguistics, or natural language processing, or natural language engineering, or human language technology. We may find the lack of computational reference a surprise, but even if there are a lot of non-computational linguists out there (as there indubitably are), why should this be a problem? The linguists may argue they have things we ought to learn from them, and it’s up to us to bridge the gap. We may argue just the reverse. But in my view there is a deeper problem. This has to do with the fact that as far as I can tell, the journal I have referred to, and other linguistics journals, are dominated by some Chomskyan paradigm. But does it matter that the linguistic zeitgeist is Chomskyan? Further, does it matter precisely which Chomskyan paradigm: older or newer, broader or more specific, pure or modified?",

  "abstract": "Idiomatic expressions are plentiful in everyday language, yet they remain mysterious, as it is not clear exactly how people learn and understand them. They are of special interest to linguists, psycholinguists, and lexicographers, mainly because of their syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies as well as their unclear lexical status. Despite a great deal of research on the properties of idioms in the linguistics literature, there is not much agreement on which properties are characteristic of these expressions. Because of their peculiarities, idiomatic expressions have mostly been overlooked by researchers in computational linguistics. In this article, we look into the usefulness of some of the identified linguistic properties of idioms for their automatic recognition. Specifically, we develop statistical measures that each model a specific property of idiomatic expressions by looking at their actual usage patterns in text. We use these statistical measures in a type-based classification task where we automatically separate idiomatic expressions (expressions with a possible idiomatic interpretation) from similar-on-the-surface literal phrases (for which no idiomatic interpretation is possible). In addition, we use some of the measures in a token identification task where we distinguish idiomatic and literal usages of potentially idiomatic expressions in context.",

  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "Sometimes I am amazed by how much the field of computational linguistics has changed in the past 15 to 20 years. In the mid 1990s, I was working at a research institute where language and speech technologists worked in relatively close quarters. Speech technology seemed on the verge of a major breakthrough; this was around the time that Bill Gates was quoted in Business Week as saying that speech was not just the future of Windows, but the future of computing itself. At the same time, language technology was, well, nowhere. Bill Gates certainly wasn’t championing language technology in those days. And while the possible applications of speech technology seemed endless (who would use a keyboard in 2010, when speech-driven user interfaces would have replaced traditional computers?), the language people were thinking hard about possible applications for their admittedly somewhat immature technologies. Predicting the future is a tricky thing. No major breakthrough came for speech technology—I am still typing this. However, language technology did change almost beyond recognition. Perhaps one of the main reasons for this has been the explosive growth of the Internet, which helped language technology in two different ways. On the one hand it instigated the development and refinement of techniques needed for searching in document collections of unprecedented size, on the other it resulted in a large increase of freely available text data. Recently, language technology has been particularly successful for tasks where huge amounts of textual data is available to which statistical machine learning techniques can be applied (Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira 2009). As a result of these developments, mainstream computational linguistics is now a successful, application-oriented discipline which is particularly good at extracting information from sequences of words. But there is more to language than that. For speakers, words are the result of a complex speech production process; for listeners, they are what starts off the similarly complex comprehension process. However, in many current applications no attention is given to the processes by which words are produced nor to the processes by which they can be understood. Language is treated as a product not as a process, in the terminology of Clark (1996). In addition, we use language not only as a vehicle for factual information exchange; speakers may realise all sorts of other intentions with their words: They may want to convince others to do or buy something, they may want to induce a particular emotion in the addressee, and so forth. These days, most of computational linguistics (with a few notable exceptions, more about which subsequently) has little to",

  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "Few archaeological finds are as evocative as artifacts inscribed with symbols. Whenever an archaeologist finds a potsherd or a seal impression that seems to have symbols scratched or impressed on the surface, it is natural to want to “read” the symbols. And if the symbols come from an undeciphered or previously unknown symbol system it is common to ask what language the symbols supposedly represent and whether the system can be deciphered. Of course the first question that really should be asked is whether the symbols are in fact writing. A writing system, as linguists usually define it, is a symbol system that is used to represent language. Familiar examples are alphabets such as the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, or Hangul alphabets, alphasyllabaries such as Devanagari or Tamil, syllabaries such as Cherokee or Kana, and morphosyllabic systems like Chinese characters. But symbol systems that do not encode language abound: European heraldry, mathematical notation, labanotation (used to represent dance), and Boy Scout merit badges are all examples of symbol systems that represent things, but do not function as part of a system that represents language. Whether an unknown system is writing or not is a difficult question to answer. It can only be answered definitively in the affirmative if one can develop a verifiable decipherment into some language or languages. Statistical techniques have been used in decipherment for years, but these have always been used under the assumption that the system one is dealing with is writing, and the techniques are used to uncover patterns or regularities that might aid in the decipherment. Patterns of symbol distribution might suggest that a symbol system is not linguistic: For example, odd repetition patterns might make it seem that a symbol system is unlikely to be writing. But until recently nobody had argued that statistical techniques could be used to determine that a system is linguistic.1 It was therefore quite a surprise when, in April 2009, there appeared in Science a short article by Rajesh Rao of the University of Washington and colleagues at two research institutes in India that purported to provide such a measure (Rao et al. 2009a).

Thick with explicatory text in 10-point Minion font, some chapters, such as that on references and modules, are consequently very difficult to work through, and are written in sometimes abstruse language (“The other thing is something to do with how we use functions,” p. 55), which further impedes full comprehension. The book’s exercises become increasingly arduous (number 24, for example, asks the reader to build a basic concordancer using the localizer “my,” which is not explained until 20 pages later), and readers must therefore resort to downloading Weisser’s solutions and trying to decipher the code themselves. Furthermore, these solutions provide programs that are usually too basic for genuine linguistic research, such as a dictionary-compiler into which the user must type every entry by hand. Because Weisser makes little reference to other work, readers leave this book with the discouraging feeling that no usable Perl code exists for linguists, and that they are still unable to write their own. The book’s greatest shortcomings are in the areas of subroutines, modules, and objects. Making only a single passing reference to CPAN in his chapter on modularity, Weisser refers to only three modules (pp. 110–112) but never provides a functioning program that uses them. Because one of Perl’s greatest strengths is in the reusability of its modules, it is disappointing to find so little on them in this book. Objects are also a great strength of Perl, but Weisser dismisses them in a dense fourpage chapter which ends, as usual, with the acknowledgment that the examples he has provided can only be made useful by writing a program “which, however, I shall leave to you as a further exercise” (p. 120). Linguists seeking a primer or classroom textbook on Perl are probably still best served by Michael Hammond’s Programming for Linguists (Blackwell, 2003), which, although it has slightly fewer examples of linguistically relevant code, brings readers to about the same skill level that Weisser’s book does, and with greater clarity.—Brian Ó Broin, William Paterson University",

  "abstract": "Our reviewing practices today are failing. With the number of ACL submissions steadily growing over the last several years (for example, ACL 2009 had a 24% increase in submissions over ACL 2008), the need for more reviewers has become more pronounced. However, qualified reviewers are becoming hard to find, and when they are found, they are often hard-pressed for time. As a result, slipshod reviews are becoming commonplace. Allowing this situation to continue as before will result in the deterioration of our ability to recognize excellence in our research. An ‘intervention’ is therefore needed. As I see it, there are two distinct problems to tackle: first, a lack of qualified reviewers, and second, a lack of quality control in reviews. After discussing these, I will suggest some solutions that I believe are worth implementing.",

  "abstract": "What are the typical genres on the Web? How can they be distinguished? What is the current application of genre theory to Web technologies? These are the sort of issues that would lead you to Genres on the Web, a collection of essays with a no-nonsense title, edited by Alexander Mehler, Serge Sharoff, and Marina Santini. If you understand categorization, but need to know something about the Web and text genres, this book is a pretty good and accessible starting point. The individual essay authors are generally well-respected experts in the field and the 16 individual essays are all solid pieces of work in their own right. The collection is well-structured with an introduction by the volume editors and four sections on, respectively, “Identifying the Sources of Web Genres,” “Automatic Web Genre Identification,” “Structure-Oriented Models of Web Genres,” and “Case Studies of Web Genres.” The bulk of the material is in the genre identification section, and could serve as the basis for a seminar in text classification more generally, as it illustrates many of the major issues and themes in text categorization. The target reader is assumed to be familiar with much of the underlying technology; for example, several authors (Santini, Chapter 5; Kim and Ross, Chapter 6; Sharoff, Chapter 7; Stein et al., Chapter 8; Braslavski, Chapter 9) talk about support vector machines, but none define or describe them. Of these authors, only Braslavski discusses alternatives, and then only in passing. This should not prove a major barrier. Other sections deal effectively with issues such as collecting and normalizing Web samples for genre research, the relationships between and among genres, and the evolution of “style” on the Web. Of particular note is the extensive collection of figures, diagrams, and tables illustrating the results of the various analyses, which help make this a particularly accessible book to the lay reader. There are two weaknesses in the collection. The first is the (lack of) discussion of the theory of genre itself; there is no clear definition of what exactly constitutes a “Web genre” aside from the simple enumeration of categories listed in benchmark corpora. Of course, this lack of clarity in the collection is a consequence of an equivalent lack of clarity among scholars of genre, as pointed out by the paper by Rosso and Haas, and this weakness should not be a stumbling block to most of the readership of Computational Linguistics. (If anything, it shows where more work on the theory of genres is needed.) The second weakness is the relative lack of discussion of genre in non-text documents. Aside from one essay (Paolillo, Warren, and Kunz) on Flash video, there is almost no attention paid to the multimedia aspects of Web publishing. This may be a more serious problem given that many of the papers describe their technology and applications in terms of improvements to Web search technologies, and text Web search is already so much more advanced than music or video search that there may be more and better applications (lower-hanging fruit) available in other areas. Despite these relatively minor weaknesses, the book remains a good reference for the current state of the art in the study of genre on the Web, and will be of interest to anyone trying to sort out a computational notion of “genre,” on or off the Web.—Patrick Juola, Duquesne University",

  "abstract": "Natural language understanding depends heavily on assessing veridicality—whether events mentioned in a text are viewed as happening or not—but little consideration is given to this property in current relation and event extraction systems. Furthermore, the work that has been done has generally assumed that veridicality can be captured by lexical semantic properties whereas we show that context and world knowledge play a significant role in shaping veridicality. We extend the FactBank corpus, which contains semantically driven veridicality annotations, with pragmatically informed ones. Our annotations are more complex than the lexical assumption predicts but systematic enough to be included in computational work on textual understanding. They also indicate that veridicality judgments are not always categorical, and should therefore be modeled as distributions. We build a classifier to automatically assign event veridicality distributions based on our new annotations. The classifier relies not only on lexical features like hedges or negations, but also on structural features and approximations of world knowledge, thereby providing a nuanced picture of the diverse factors that shape veridicality.",

The composite language model has been trained by performing a convergent N-best list approximate EM algorithm and a follow-up EM algorithm to improve word prediction power on corpora with up to a billion tokens and stored on a supercomputer. The large scale distributed composite language model gives drastic perplexity reduction over n-grams and achieves significantly better translation quality measured by the Bleu score and “readability” of translations when applied to the task of re-ranking the N-best list from a state-of-the-art parsing-based machine translation system.",

Such measures rely on sample-based estimates of the entropy. However, the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the entropy are heavily biased with the bias dependent on, among other things, the number of clusters and the sample size. This makes the measures unreliable and unfair when the number of clusters produced by different systems vary and the sample size is not exceedingly large. This corresponds exactly to the setting of WSI evaluation where a ground-truth cluster sense number arguably does not exist and the standard evaluation scenarios use a small number of instances of each word to compute the score. We describe more accurate entropy estimators and analyze their performance both in simulations and on evaluation of WSI systems.",

Despite concerns raised in the past about using cross-validation for data of similar characteristics, such as time series, some of these studies evaluate their work using standard k-fold cross-validation. Through experiments on Twitter data collected during a two-year period that includes disastrous events, we show that by ignoring the statistical dependence of the text messages published in social media, standard cross-validation can result in misleading conclusions in a machine learning task. We explore alternative evaluation methods that explicitly deal with statistical dependence in text. Our work also raises concerns for any other data for which similar conditions might hold.",

  "venue": "CL",
  "abstract": "linguistic representations. The main advantages of SMT are versatility and costeffectiveness: In principle, the same modeling framework can be applied to any pair of languages with minimal engineering effort, given sufficient amounts of translation data. However, experience in a diverse range of language pairs has revealed that this form of modeling is highly sensitive to structural differences between source and target language, particularly at the level of word order. Indeed, natural languages vary greatly in how they arrange sentence components, and translating words in the correct order is essential to preserving meaning across languages. In English, for instance, the role of different predicate arguments is determined precisely by their relative position within the sentence. Consider the translation example in Figure 1: Looking at the English glosses of the Arabic sentence, one can see that corresponding words in the two languages are placed in overall similar orders with the notable exception of the verb (jdd/renewed), which occurs at the beginning of the Arabic sentence but in the middle of the English one—more specifically, between the subject and the object. To reach the correct English order, three other reorderings are required between pairs of adjacent Arabic words: (AlEAhl/the-monarch, Almgrby/the-Moroccan), (dEm/support, -h/his), and (Alr}ys/the-president, Alfrnsy/the-French). This example suggests a simple division of reordering patterns into long range, or global, and short range, or local. However, other language pairs display more complex, hierarchical patterns. Word reordering phenomena are naturally handled by human translators1 but are a major source of complexity for SMT. In very general terms, the task of SMT consists of breaking the input sentence into smaller units, selecting an optimal translation for each unit, and placing them in the correct order. Searching for the overall best translation throughout the space of all possible reorderings is, however, computationally intractable (Knight 1999). This crucial fact has motivated an impressive amount of research around two inter-related questions: namely, how to effectively restrict the set of allowed word permutations and how to detect the best permutation among them. Existing solutions to these problems range from heuristic constraints, based on word-to-word distances and completely agnostic about the sentence content, to linguistically motivated SMT frameworks where the entire translation process is guided by syntactic structure. The research in word reordering has advanced together with core SMT research and has sometimes directed it, being one of the main motivations for the development of tree-based SMT. At the same time, the variety of word orders existing in world languages has pressed the SMT community to admit the importance of 1 Nevertheless, learning and understanding a new language has been shown to be more difficult when the new language is structurally distant from one’s native language (Corder 1979).",

A novel cross-lingual learning objective is proposed which directly matches the distributions of word embeddings in one language with that in the other language. During the joint learning process, we dynamically estimate the distributions of word embeddings in two languages respectively and minimize the dissimilarity between them through standard back propagation algorithm. Our learned bilingual word embeddings allow to group each word and its translations together in the shared vector space. We demonstrate the utility of the learned embeddings on the task of finding word-to-word translations from monolingual corpora.

The first model is based on translations, but uses Gaussians to explicitly model the variability of these translations and to encode soft constraints on the source and target words that may be chosen.

We take a closer look at a subset of such revisions, for which we attempt to improve a computational model and validate in how far the assumption that 'revised means better' actually holds. The subset of revisions considered here are noun substitutions, which often involve interesting semantic relations, including synonymy, antonymy and hypernymy. Despite the high semantic relatedness, we find that a supervised classifier can distinguish the revised version of a sentence from an original version with an accuracy close to 70%, when taking context into account. In a human annotation study, we observe that annotators identify the revised sentence as the 'better version' with similar performance. Our analysis reveals a fair agreement among annotators when a revision improves fluency. In contrast, noun substitutions that involve other lexical-semantic relationships are often perceived as being equally good or tend to cause disagreements. While these findings are also reflected in classification scores, a comparison of results shows that our model fails in cases where humans can resort to factual knowledge or intuitions about the required level of specificity.",

  "abstract": "In text summarization, evaluating the efficacy of automatic metrics without human judgments has become recently popular. One exemplar work (Peyrard, 2019) concludes that automatic metrics strongly disagree when ranking high-scoring summaries. In this paper, we revisit their experiments and find that their observations stem from the fact that metrics disagree in ranking summaries from any narrow scoring range. We hypothesize that this may be because summaries are similar to each other in a narrow scoring range and are thus, difficult to rank. Apart from the width of the scoring range of summaries, we analyze three other properties that impact inter-metric agreement - Ease of Summarization, Abstractiveness, and Coverage.",

  "title": "Generating Synthetic Speech Prosody with Lazy Learning in Tree Structures",
  "year": 2000,
  "venue": "CoNLL",
  "abstract": "We present ongoing work on prosody prediction for speech synthesis. This approach considers sentences as tree structures and infers the prosody from a corpus of such structures using machine learning techniques. The prediction is achieved from the prosody of the closest sentence of the corpus through tree similarity measurements, using either the nearest neighbour algorithm or an analogy-based approach. We introduce two different tree structure representations, the tree similarity metrics considered, and then we discuss the different prediction methods. Experiments are currently under process to qualify this approach. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Natural prosody production remains a problem in speech synthesis systems. Several automatic prediction methods have already been tried for this, including decision trees (Ross, 1995), neural networks (Traber, 1992), and HMMs (Jensen et al., 1994). The original aspect of our prediction approach is a tree structure representation of sentences, and the use of tree similarity measurements to achieve the prosody prediction. We think that reasoning on a whole structure rather than on local features of a sentence should better reflect the many relations influencing the prosody. This approach is an at tempt to achieve such a goal. The data used in this work is a part of the Boston University Radio (WBUR) News Corpus (Ostendorfet al., 1995). The prosodic information consists of ToBI labeling of accents and breaks (Silverman et al., 1992). The syntactic and part-of-speech informations were obtained from the part of the corpus processed in the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993). We firstly describe the tree structures defined for this work, then present the tree metrics that we are using, and finally discuss how they are manipulated to achieve the prosody prediction. 2 T r e e S t r u c t u r e s So far we have considered two types of structures in this work: a simple syntactic structure and a performance structure (Gee and Grosjean, 1983). Their comparison in use should provide some interesting knowledge about the usefulness or the limitations of the elements of information included in each one. 2.1 Syntactic Structure The syntactic structure considered is built exclusively from the syntactic parsing of the given sentences. This parsing, with the relative syntactic tags, constitute the backbone of the structure. Below this structure lie the words of the sentence, with their part-of-speech tags. Additional levels of nodes can be added deeper in the structure to represent the syllables of each word, and the phonemes of each syllable. The syntactic structure corresponding to the sentence \"Hennessy will be a hard act to follow\" is presented in Figure 1 as an example (the syllable level has been omit ted for clarity). 2.2 P e r f o r m a n c e Structure The performance structure used in our approach is a combination of syntactic and phonological informations. Its upper part is a binary tree where each node represents a break between the two parts of the sentence contained into the subtrees of the node. This binary structure defines a hierarchy: the closer to the root the node is, the more salient (or stronger) the break is.",

The frequencies of relevant events are considered to be properties of the process. When building a model we have to constrain our attention to models with these properties. In most cases the process is only partially described. The MaxEnt framework now demands that from all the models that satisfy these constraints, we choose the model with the flattest probability distribution. This is the model with the highest entropy (given the fact that the constraints are met). When we are looking for a conditional model P(w]h), the MaxEnt solution has the form:",

Our system is only a semantic role labeling system, and thus did not receive a score for Syntactic Dependencies (or, by extension, a score for the complete problem). Unlike most systems in the shared task, our system took constituency parses as input. On the subtask of semantic dependencies, our system obtained an F1 score of 76.17, the highest in the open task.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the interactive feature space construction protocol, where the learner identifies inadequate regions of the feature space and in coordination with a domain expert adds descriptiveness through existing semantic resources. We demonstrate effectiveness on an entity and relation extraction system including both performance improvements and robustness to reductions in annotated data.",

The first project I’ll describe is to identify words that are downward entailing, a task that promises to enhance the performance of systems that engage in textual inference, and one that is quite challenging since it is difficult to characterize these items as a class and no corpus with downward-entailingness annotations exists. We are able to surmount these challenges by utilizing some insights from the linguistics literature regarding the relationship between downward entailing operators and what are known as negative polarity items — words such as “ever” or the idiom “have a clue” that tend to occur only in negative contexts.

  "abstract": "Modern unsupervised POS taggers usually apply an optimization procedure to a nonconvex function, and tend to converge to local maxima that are sensitive to starting conditions. The quality of the tagging induced by such algorithms is thus highly variable, and researchers report average results over several random initializations. Consequently, applications are not guaranteed to use an induced tagging of the quality reported for the algorithm. In this paper we address this issue using an unsupervised test for intrinsic clustering quality. We run a base tagger with different random initializations, and select the best tagging using the quality test. As a base tagger, we modify a leading unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) to constrain the distributions of word types across clusters to be Zipfian, allowing us to utilize a perplexity-based quality test. We show that the correlation between our quality test and gold standard-based tagging quality measures is high. Our results are better in most evaluation measures than all results reported in the literature for this task, and are always better than the Clark average results.",

We then apply our method to four English dependency parsers (an Arc-Eager and Arc-Standard transition-based parsers, and firstand second-order graph-based parsers). We show that all four parsers are biased with respect to the kind of annotation they are trained to parse. We present a detailed analysis of the biases that highlights specific differences and commonalities between the parsing systems, and improves our understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.",

In this paper, we explore statistical techniques that can learn to identify the gender of authors in modern English text, such as web blogs and scientific papers. Although recent work has shown the efficacy of statistical approaches to gender attribution, we conjecture that the reported performance might be overly optimistic due to non-stylistic factors such as topic bias in gender that can make the gender detection task easier. Our work is the first that consciously avoids gender bias in topics, thereby providing stronger evidence to gender-specific styles in language beyond topic. In addition, our comparative study provides new insights into robustness of various stylometric techniques across topic and genre.",

State-of-the-art approaches address this issue by implicitly expanding the queries with additional words using statistical translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependant on the availability of quality corpus in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. Moreover these models perform word based expansion in a context agnostic manner resulting in translation that might be mixed and fairly general. This results in degraded retrieval performance. In this work we address the above issues by extending the lexical word based translation model to incorporate semantic concepts (entities). We explore strategies to learn the translation probabilities between words and the concepts using the Q&A archives and a popular entity catalog. Experiments conducted on a large scale real data show that the proposed techniques are promising.",

  "abstract": "Within the natural language processing (NLP) community, active learning has been widely investigated and applied in order to alleviate the annotation bottleneck faced by developers of new NLP systems and technologies. This paper presents the first theoretical analysis of stopping active learning based on stabilizing predictions (SP). The analysis has revealed three elements that are central to the success of the SP method: (1) bounds on Cohen’s Kappa agreement between successively trained models impose bounds on differences in F-measure performance of the models; (2) since the stop set does not have to be labeled, it can be made large in practice, helping to guarantee that the results transfer to previously unseen streams of examples at test/application time; and (3) good (low variance) sample estimates of Kappa between successive models can be obtained. Proofs of relationships between the level of Kappa agreement and the difference in performance between consecutive models are presented. Specifically, if the Kappa agreement between two models exceeds a threshold T (where T > 0), then the difference in F-measure performance between those models is bounded above by 4(1−T ) T in all cases. If precision of the positive conjunction of the models is assumed to be p, then the bound can be tightened to 4(1−T ) (p+1)T .",

In this paper, we take a step towards answering these questions. We analyze the computational power as captured by Turing-completeness. We first provide an alternate and simpler proof to show that vanilla Transformers are Turing-complete and then we prove that Transformers with only positional masking and without any positional encoding are also Turing-complete. We further analyze the necessity of each component for the Turing-completeness of the network; interestingly, we find that a particular type of residual connection is necessary.

  "venue": "EMNLP",
  "abstract": "The original motivation for using question series in the TREC 2004 question answering track was the desire to model aspects of dialogue processing in an evaluation task that included different question types. The structure introduced by the series also proved to have an important additional benefit: the series is at an appropriate level of granularity for aggregating scores for an effective evaluation. The series is small enough to be meaningful at the task level since it represents a single user interaction, yet it is large enough to avoid the highly skewed score distributions exhibited by single questions. An analysis of the reliability of the per-series evaluation shows the evaluation is stable for differences in scores seen in the track. The development of question answering technology in recent years has been driven by tasks defined in community-wide evaluations such as TREC, NTCIR, and CLEF. The TREC question answering (QA) track started in 1999, with the first several editions of the track focused on factoid questions. A factoid question is a fact-based, short answer question such as How many calories are there in a Big Mac?. The track has evolved by increasing the type and difficulty of questions that are included in the test set. The task in the TREC 2003 QA track was a combined task that contained list and definition questions in addition to factoid questions (Voorhees, 2004). A list question asks for different instances of a particular kind of information to be returned, such as List the names of chewing gums. Answering such questions requires a system to assemble an answer from information located in multiple documents. A definition question asks for interesting information about a particular person or thing such as Who is Vlad the Impaler? or What is a golden parachute?. Definition questions also require systems to locate information in multiple documents, but in this case the information of interest is much less crisply delineated. Like the NTCIR4 QACIAD challenge (Kato et al., 2004), the TREC 2004 QA track grouped questions into series, using the series as abstractions of information-seeking dialogues. In addition to modeling a real user task, the series are a step toward incorporating context-processing into QA evaluation since earlier questions in a series provide some context for the current question. In the case of the TREC series, each series contained factoid and list questions and had the target of a definition associated with it. Each question in a series asked for some information about the target. In addition, the final question in each series was an explicit “other” question, which was to be interpreted as “Tell me other interesting things about this target I don’t know enough to ask directly”. This last question was roughly equivalent to the definition questions in the",

The method is best when the system will eventually be evaluated using the same metric, but in reality, most MT evaluations have a human-based component. Although performing MERT with a human-based metric seems like a daunting task, we describe a new metric, RYPT, which takes human judgments into account, but only requires human input to build a database that can be reused over and over again, hence eliminating the need for human input at tuning time. In this investigative study, we analyze the diversity (or lack thereof) of the candidates produced during MERT, we describe how this redundancy can be used to our advantage, and show that RYPT is a better predictor of translation quality than BLEU.",

In this paper, we propose methods of using new linguistic and contextual features that do not suffer from this problem and apply them in a state-ofthe-art hierarchical MT system. The features used in this work are non-terminal labels, non-terminal length distribution, source string context and source dependency LM scores. The effectiveness of our techniques is demonstrated by significant improvements over a strong baseline. On Arabic-to-English translation, improvements in lower-cased BLEU are 2.0 on NIST MT06 and 1.7 on MT08 newswire data on decoding output.

Since the social intentions of the speaker may differ from what is perceived by the hearer, systems that analyze human conversations need to be able to extract both the perceived and the intended social meaning. We investigate this difference between intention and perception by using a spoken corpus of speed-dates in which both the speaker and the listener rated the speaker on flirtatiousness. Our flirtationdetection system uses prosodic, dialogue, and lexical features to detect a speaker’s intent to flirt with up to 71.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline, but also outperforming the human interlocuters. Our system addresses lexical feature sparsity given the small amount of training data by using an autoencoder network to map sparse lexical feature vectors into 30 compressed features. Our analysis shows that humans are very poor perceivers of intended flirtatiousness, instead often projecting their own intended behavior onto their interlocutors.",

Exact match click features tend to suffer from severe data sparsity issues in web ranking. Such sparsity is particularly pronounced for new URLs or long queries where each distinct query-url pair will rarely occur. To remedy this, we present a set of straightforward yet informative query-url n-gram features that allows for generalization of limited user click data to large amounts of unseen query-url pairs. The method is motivated by techniques leveraged in the NLP community for dealing with unseen words. We find that there are interesting regularities across queries and their preferred destination URLs; for example, queries containing “form” tend to lead to clicks on URLs containing “pdf”. We evaluate our set of new query-url features on a web search ranking task and obtain improvements that are statistically significant at a p-value < 0.0001 level over a strong baseline with exact match clickthrough features.",

A critical problem for the task-specific ranking is training data insufficiency, which may be solved by using the data extracted from click log. This paper empirically studies how to appropriately exploit click data to improve rank function learning in task-specific ranking. The main contributions are 1) the exploration on the utilities of two promising approaches for click pair extraction; 2) the analysis of the role played by the noise information which inevitably appears in click data extraction; 3) the appropriate strategy for combining training data and click data; 4) the comparison of click data which are consistent and inconsistent with baseline function.",

We also investigate different augmentation strategies in iteratively adding reliable instances to the labeled set, and find that the bootstrapping procedure may stop at a reasonable point to significantly decrease the training time without degrading too much in performance. Experiments on the ACE RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora show the stratified sampling strategy contributes more than the bootstrapping procedure itself.

Traditional binary classification involves building a classifier using labeled positive and negative training examples. The classifier is then applied to classify test instances into positive and negative classes. A fundamental assumption is that the training and test data are identically distributed. However, this assumption may not hold in practice. In this paper, we study a particular problem where the positive data is identically distributed but the negative data may or may not be so. Many practical text classification and retrieval applications fit this model. We argue that in this setting negative training data should not be used, and that PU learning can be employed to solve the problem. Empirical evaluation has been conducted to support our claim. This result is important as it may fundamentally change the current binary classification paradigm.",

We show the effects both with document-level topic analysis (document clustering) and with word-level topic analysis (LDA) on both synthetic and real-world OCR data. As expected, experimental results show that performance declines as word error rates increase. Common techniques for alleviating these problems, such as filtering low-frequency words, are successful in enhancing model quality, but exhibit failure trends similar to models trained on unprocessed OCR output in the case of LDA.

Based on these studies, we observe that: (1) bidirectional models tend to achieve better accuracy levels than left-toright models, (2) generative models seem to perform somewhat better than discriminative models on this task, and (3) prosody improves tagging performance of models on conversation sides, but has much less impact on smaller segments. We conclude that, although the use of break indexes can indeed significantly improve performance over baseline models without them on conversation sides, tagging accuracy improves more by using smaller segments, for which the impact of the break indexes is marginal.",

The scarcity of jointly labeled data presents a crucial technical challenge for learning a joint model. The key strength of our model is that we use existing structure predictors as black boxes. By enforcing consistency constraints between their predictions, we show improvements in the performance of both tasks without retraining the individual models.",

Hence we investigate an important and challenging problem in summary generation, i.e., Interactive Personalized Summarization (IPS), which generates summaries in an interactive and personalized manner. Given the source documents, IPS captures user interests by enabling interactive clicks and incorporates personalization by modeling captured reader preference. We develop experimental systems to compare 5 rival algorithms on 4 instinctively different datasets which amount to 5197 documents. Evaluation results in ROUGE metrics indicate the comparable performance between IPS and the best competing system but IPS produces summaries with much more user satisfaction according to evaluator ratings.

  "venue": "EMNLP",
  "abstract": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone’s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today’s computers and algorithms.",

In this study, we test whether image-based models capture the semantic patterns that emerge from fMRI recordings of the neural signal. Our results indicate that, indeed, there is a significant correlation between image-based and brain-based semantic similarities, and that image-based models complement text-based ones, so that the best correlations are achieved when the two modalities are combined. Despite some unsatisfactory, but explained outcomes (in particular, failure to detect differential association of models with brain areas), the results show, on the one hand, that imagebased distributional semantic models can be a precious new tool to explore semantic representation in the brain, and, on the other, that neural data can be used as the ultimate test set to validate artificial semantic models in terms of their cognitive plausibility.",

  "abstract": "In November 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to directly supervise the largest banks in the Eurozone via the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). While supervisory risk assessments are usually based on quantitative data and surveys, this work explores whether sentiment analysis is capable of measuring a bank’s attitude and opinions towards risk by analyzing text data. For realizing this study, a collection consisting of more than 500 CEO letters and outlook sections extracted from bank annual reports is built up. Based on these data, two distinct experiments are conducted. The evaluations find promising opportunities, but also limitations for risk sentiment analysis in banking supervision. At the level of individual banks, predictions are relatively inaccurate. In contrast, the analysis of aggregated figures revealed strong and significant correlations between uncertainty or negativity in textual disclosures and the quantitative risk indicator’s future evolution. Risk sentiment analysis should therefore rather be used for macroprudential analyses than for assessments of individual banks.",

We call such sentences content heavy: these are possibly grammatical but difficult to comprehend, cumbersome sentences. In this paper we introduce the task of detecting content-heavy sentences in cross-lingual context. Specifically we develop methods to identify sentences in Chinese for which English speakers would prefer translations consisting of more than one sentence. We base our analysis and definitions on evidence from multiple human translations and reader preferences on flow and understandability. We show that machine translation quality when translating content heavy sentences is markedly worse than overall quality and that this type of sentence are fairly common in Chinese news. We demonstrate that sentence length and punctuation usage in Chinese are not sufficient clues for accurately detecting heavy sentences and present a richer classification model that accurately identifies these sentences.",

Several computational cognitive models have explored aspects of this phenomenon, but their results are hard to compare given the high variability in the linguistic properties represented in their input. In this paper, we directly compare two recent approaches, a Bayesian model and a connectionist model, in their ability to replicate human judgments of appropriate generalizations. We find that the Bayesian model more accurately mimics the judgments due to its richer learning mechanism that can exploit distributional properties of the input in a manner consistent with human behaviour.",

In this work, we analyse the implications of this variation on the language modeling (LM) task. We present a large-scale study of state-of-the art n-gram based and neural language models on 50 typologically diverse languages covering a wide variety of morphological systems. Operating in the full vocabulary LM setup focused on word-level prediction, we demonstrate that a coarse typology of morphological systems is predictive of absolute LM performance. Moreover, fine-grained typological features such as exponence, flexivity, fusion, and inflectional synthesis are borne out to be responsible for the proliferation of low-frequency phenomena which are organically difficult to model by statistical architectures, or for the meaning ambiguity of character n-grams. Our study strongly suggests that these features have to be taken into consideration during the construction of next-level language-agnostic LM architectures, capable of handling morphologically complex languages such as Tamil or Korean.",

In addition, we also target the contexts of difficult words and sample sentences that are similar in context.

We investigate these questions on the standard image captioning benchmark, MSCOCO, using a diverse set of models.

Moreover, we show that often models do not generalize well to examples from annotators that did not contribute to the training set.

In this paper, we study the problem of predicting the performance drop of modern NLP models under domain-shift, in the absence of any target domain labels. We investigate three families of methods ($H$-divergence, reverse classification accuracy and confidence measures), show how they can be used to predict the performance drop and study their robustness to adversarial domain-shifts. Our results on sentiment classification and sequence labelling show that our method is able to predict performance drops with an error rate as low as 2.15% and 0.89% for sentiment analysis and POS tagging respectively.",

We investigate whether a state-of-the-art natural language inference model (BERT) learns to make correct inferences about veridicality in verb-complement constructions. We introduce an NLI dataset for veridicality evaluation consisting of 1,500 sentence pairs, covering 137 unique verbs. We find that both human and model inferences generally follow theoretical patterns, but exhibit a systematic bias towards assuming that verbs are veridical-a bias which is amplified in BERT. We further show that, encouragingly, BERT's inferences are sensitive not only to the presence of individual verb types, but also to the syntactic role of the verb, the form of the complement clause (to- vs. that-complements), and negation.",

However, these models often suffer from limited performance when working on sparse and incomplete graphs, due to the lack of evidential paths that can reach target entities. Here we study open knowledge graph reasoning-a task that aims to reason for missing facts over a graph augmented by a background text corpus. A key challenge of the task is to filter out \"irrelevant\" facts extracted from corpus, in order to maintain an effective search space during path inference. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to train two collaborative agents jointly, i.e., a multi-hop graph reasoner and a fact extractor. The fact extraction agent generates fact triples from corpora to enrich the graph on the fly; while the reasoning agent provides feedback to the fact extractor and guides it towards promoting facts that are helpful for the interpretable reasoning.

In contrast with the standard computational approach that simplistically treats gradable adjectives as 'fixed' attributes, we pose the problem as relational: to be successful, a model has to consider the full visual context. By means of four main tasks, we show that state-of-the-art models (but not a relatively strong baseline) can learn the function subtending the meaning of size adjectives, though their performance is found to decrease while moving from simple to more complex tasks.

Here we investigate neural models' ability to represent constituent-level features, using coordinated noun phrases as a case study. We assess whether different neural language models trained on English and French represent phrase-level number and gender features, and use those features to drive downstream expectations. Our results suggest that models use a linear combination of NP constituent number to drive CoordNP/verb number agreement. This behavior is highly regular and even sensitive to local syntactic context, however it differs crucially from observed human behavior. Models have less success with gender agreement.

To address aforementioned problems, not only do we model each table cell considering other records in the same row, we also enrich table's representation by modeling each table cell in context of other cells in the same column or with historical (time dimension) data respectively. In addition, we develop a table cell fusion gate to combine representations from row, column and time dimension into one dense vector according to the saliency of each dimension's representation. We evaluated our methods on ROTOWIRE, a benchmark dataset of NBA basketball games.

Surprisingly, beam search fails to find these global best model scores in most cases, even with a very large beam size of 100. For more than 50% of the sentences, the model in fact assigns its global best score to the empty translation, revealing a massive failure of neural models in properly accounting for adequacy. We show by constraining search with a minimum translation length that at the root of the problem of empty translations lies an inherent bias towards shorter translations.

We test five models on various NLU datasets and compare their performance using three incremental evaluation metrics. The results support the possibility of using bidirectional encoders in incremental mode while retaining most of their non-incremental quality. The \"omni-directional\" BERT model, which achieves better non-incremental performance, is impacted more by the incremental access.

We evaluate this on Transformer and BERT models on multiple NLP tasks. Firstly, we find that a large fraction of the attention heads can be randomly pruned with limited effect on accuracy. Secondly, for Transformers, we find no advantage in pruning attention heads identified to be important based on existing studies that relate importance to the location of a head. On the BERT model too we find no preference for top or bottom layers, though the latter are reported to have higher importance. However, strategies that avoid pruning middle layers and consecutive layers perform better. Finally, during fine-tuning the compensation for pruned attention heads is roughly equally distributed across the un-pruned heads. Our results thus suggest that interpretation of attention heads does not strongly inform pruning.",

This requires the model to keep track of the dynamic states of the latent plot, conditioning on the input outline while generating the full story. We present PlotMachines, a neural narrative model that learns to transform an outline into a coherent story by tracking the dynamic plot states. In addition, we enrich PlotMachines with high-level discourse structure so that the model can learn different writing styles corresponding to different parts of the narrative. Comprehensive experiments over three fiction and non-fiction datasets demonstrate that large-scale language models, such as GPT-2 and Grover, despite their impressive generation performance, are not sufficient in generating coherent narratives for the given outline, and dynamic plot state tracking is important for composing narratives with tighter, more consistent plots.",

We question this claim. We measure which words benefit most from the latent information by decomposing the reconstruction loss per position in the sentence. Using this method, we find that VAEs are prone to memorizing the first words and the sentence length, producing local features of limited usefulness. To alleviate this, we investigate alternative architectures based on bag-of-words assumptions and language model pretraining. These variants learn latent variables that are more global, i.e., more predictive of topic or sentiment labels. Moreover, using reconstructions, we observe that they decrease memorization: the first word and the sentence length are not recovered as accurately than with the baselines, consequently yielding more diverse reconstructions.",

Our experiments, encompassing three lower-level tasks (POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER) and two high-level tasks (NLI, QA), empirically correlate transfer performance with linguistic proximity between source and target languages, but also with the size of target language corpora used in MMT pretraining.

English dev accuracy is often uncorrelated (or even anti-correlated) with target language accuracy, and zero-shot performance varies greatly at different points in the same fine-tuning run and between different fine-tuning runs.

We first show that MT systems can be stolen by querying them with monolingual sentences and training models to imitate their outputs. Using simulated experiments, we demonstrate that MT model stealing is possible even when imitation models have different input data or architectures than their target models. Applying these ideas, we train imitation models that reach within 0.6 BLEU of three production MT systems on both high-resource and low-resource language pairs. We then leverage the similarity of our imitation models to transfer adversarial examples to the production systems. We use gradient-based attacks that expose inputs which lead to semantically-incorrect translations, dropped content, and vulgar model outputs. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a defense that modifies translation outputs in order to misdirect the optimization of imitation models. This defense degrades the adversary's BLEU score and attack success rate at some cost in the defender's BLEU and inference speed.",

Building on studies from social psychology, we analyze the language of condolence and develop a new dataset for quantifying the empathy in a condolence using appraisal theory. Finally, we demonstrate that the features of condolence individuals find most helpful online differ substantially in their features from those seen in interpersonal settings.",

  "year": 2020,
  "venue": "EMNLP",
  "abstract": "We present LAReQA, a challenging new benchmark for language-agnostic answer retrieval from a multilingual candidate pool. Unlike previous cross-lingual tasks, LAReQA tests for \"strong\" cross-lingual alignment, requiring semantically related cross-language pairs to be closer in representation space than unrelated same-language pairs. This level of alignment is important for the practical task of cross-lingual information retrieval. Building on multilingual BERT (mBERT), we study different strategies for achieving strong alignment. We find that augmenting training data via machine translation is effective, and improves significantly over using mBERT out-of-the-box. Interestingly, model performance on zero-shot variants of our task that only target \"weak\" alignment is not predictive of performance on LAReQA. This finding underscores our claim that language-agnostic retrieval is a substantively new kind of cross-lingual evaluation, and suggests that measuring both weak and strong alignment will be important for improving cross-lingual systems going forward. We release our dataset and evaluation code at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/lareqa.",

This paper studies the types of linguistic phenomena accounted for by language models in the context of a Conversational Question Answering (CoQA) task. We identify the problematic areas for the finetuned RoBERTa, BERT and DistilBERT models through systematic error analysis - basic arithmetic (counting phrases), compositional semantics (negation and Semantic Role Labeling), and lexical semantics (surprisal and antonymy). When enhanced with the relevant linguistic knowledge through multitask learning, the models improve in performance. Ensembles of the enhanced models yield a boost between 2.2 and 2.7 points in F1 score overall, and up to 42.1 points in F1 on the hardest question classes. The results show differences in ability to represent compositional and lexical information between RoBERTa, BERT and DistilBERT.",

  "abstract": "Transformers have supplanted recurrent models in a large number of NLP tasks. However, the differences in their abilities to model different syntactic properties remain largely unknown. Past works suggest that LSTMs generalize very well on regular languages and have close connections with counter languages. In this work, we systematically study the ability of Transformers to model such languages as well as the role of its individual components in doing so. We first provide a construction of Transformers for a subclass of counter languages, including well-studied languages such as n-ary Boolean Expressions, Dyck-1, and its generalizations. In experiments, we find that Transformers do well on this subclass, and their learned mechanism strongly correlates with our construction. Perhaps surprisingly, in contrast to LSTMs, Transformers do well only on a subset of regular languages with degrading performance as we make languages more complex according to a well-known measure of complexity. Our analysis also provides insights on the role of self-attention mechanism in modeling certain behaviors and the influence of positional encoding schemes on the learning and generalization abilities of the model.",

We introduce a method for the prediction of disambiguation errors based on statistical data properties, demonstrating its effectiveness across several domains and model types. Moreover, we develop a simple adversarial attack strategy that minimally perturbs sentences in order to elicit disambiguation errors to further probe the robustness of translation models. Our findings indicate that disambiguation robustness varies substantially between domains and that different models trained on the same data are vulnerable to different attacks.",

In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework for open attribute value extraction.

Unfortunately, when a dataset has systematic gaps (e.g., annotation artifacts), these evaluations are misleading: a model can learn simple decision rules that perform well on the test set but do not capture the abilities a dataset is intended to test. We propose a more rigorous annotation paradigm for NLP that helps to close systematic gaps in the test data. In particular, after a dataset is constructed, we recommend that the dataset authors manually perturb the test instances in small but meaningful ways that (typically) change the gold label, creating contrast sets. Contrast sets provide a local view of a model's decision boundary, which can be used to more accurately evaluate a model's true linguistic capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of contrast sets by creating them for 10 diverse NLP datasets (e.g., DROP reading comprehension, UD parsing, and IMDb sentiment analysis). Although our contrast sets are not explicitly adversarial, model performance is significantly lower on them than on the original test sets-up to 25% in some cases. We release our contrast sets as new evaluation benchmarks and encourage future dataset construction efforts to follow similar annotation processes.",

  "abstract": "This paper reports on work carried out to develop a spelling and grammar corrector for Danish, addressing in particular the issue of how a form of shallow parsing is combined with error detection and correction for the treatment of context-dependent spelling errors. The syntactic grammar for Danish used by the system has been developed with the aim of dealing with the most frequent error types found in a parallel corpus of unedited and proofread texts specifically collected by the project's end users. By focussing on certain grammatical constructions and certain error types, it has been possible to exploit the linguistic 'intelligence' provided by syntactic parsing and yet keep the system robust and efficient. The system described is thus superior to other existing spelling checkers for Danish in its ability to deal with contextdependent errors. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n In her much-quoted and still relevant review o f technologies for automatic word correction (Kukich, 1992), Kukich observes that \"research in context-dependent spelling correction is in its infancy\" (p. 429), and that the task of treating context-dependent errors is still an elusive one due to the complexity of the linguistic knowledge often necessary to analyse the context in sufficient depth to find and correct such errors. But progress in parsing technology and the growing speed of computers seem to have made the task less of a chimera. The '90s have in fact seen a renewed interest in grammar checking, and proposals have been made for systems covering English (Bernth, 1997) and other languages such as Italian (Bolioli et al., 1992), Spanish and Greek (Bustamante and Ldon, 1996), Czech (Holan et al., 1997) and Swedish (Hein, 1998). This paper describes the prototype of a spelling and grammar corrector for Danish which combines traditional spelling checking functionalities with the ability to carry out compound analysis and to detect and correct certain types of context-dependent spelling errors (hereafter simply \"grammar errors\"). Grammar correction is carried out by parsing the text, making use of feature overriding and error weights to accommodate the errors. Although a full parse of each sentence is at tempted, the grammar has been developed with the aim of dealing only with the most frequent error types found in a parallel corpus of unedited and proofread texts specifically collected by the project's end users. By focussing on certain grammatical constructions and certain error types, it has been possible to exploit the linguistic 'intelligence' provided by syntactic parsing and yet keep the system robust and efficient.

  "title": "Predicting Automatic Speech Recognition Performance Using Prosodic Cues",
  "year": 2000,
  "venue": "NAACL",
  "abstract": "In spoken dialogue systems, it is important for a system to know how likely a speech recognition hypothesis is to be correct, so it can reprompt for fresh input, or, in cases where many errors have occurred, change its interaction strategy or switch the caller to a human attendant. We have discovered prosodic features which more accurately predict when a recognition hypothesis contains a word error than the acoustic confidence score thresholds traditionally used in automatic speech recognition. We present analytic results indicating that there are significant prosodic differences between correctly and incorrectly recognized turns in the T O O T train information corpus. We then present machine learning results showing how the use of prosodic features to automatically predict correct versus incorrectly recognized turns improves over the use of acoustic confidence scores alone. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n One of the central tasks of the dialogue manager in most current spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) is error handling. The automatic speech recognition (ASR) component of such systems is prone to error, especially when the system has to operate in noisy conditions or when the domain of the system is large. Given that it is impossible to fully prevent ASR errors, it is important for a system to know how likely a speech recognition hypothesis is to be correct, so it can take appropriate action, since users have considerable difficulty correcting incorrect information that is presented by the system as true (Krahmer et al., 1999). Such action may include verifying the user's input, reprompting for fresh input, or, in cases where many errors have occurred, changing the interaction strategy or switching the caller to a human attendant (Smith, 1998; Litman et al., 1999; Langkilde et al., 1999). Traditionally, the decision to rej ec t a recognition hypothesis is based on acoustic confidence score thresholds, which provide a reliability measure on the hypothesis and are set in the application (Zeljkovic, 1996). However, this process often fails, as there is no simple one-to-one mapping between low confidence scores and incorrect recognitions, and the setting of a rejection threshold is a matter of trial and error (Bouwman et al., 1999). Also, some incorrect recognitions do not necessarily lead to misunderstandings at a conceptual level (e.g. \"a.m.\" recognized as \"in the morning\"). The current paper looks at prosody as one possible predictor of ASR performance. ASR performance is known to vary based upon speaking style (Weintraub et al., 1996), speaker gender and age, native versus non-native speaker status, and, in general, the deviation of new speech from the training data. Some of this variation is linked to prosody, as prosodic differences have been found to characterize differences in speaking style (Blaauw, 1992) and idiosyncratic differences (Kraayeveld, 1997). Several other studies (Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al., 1996; Swerts and Ostendorf, 1997; Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999) report that hyperarticulated speech, characterized by careful enunciation, slowed speaking rate, and increase in pitch and loudness, often occurs when users in human-machine interactions try to correct system errors. Still others have shown that such speech also decreases recognition performance (Soltau and Waibel, 1998). Prosodic features have also been shown to be effective in ranking recognition hypotheses, as a post-processing filter to score ASR hypotheses (Hirschberg, 1991; Veilleux, 1994; Hirose, 1997). In this paper we present results of empirical studies testing the hypothesis that prosodic features provide an important clue to ASR performance. We first present results comparing prosodic analyses of correctly and incorrectly recognized speaker turns in TOOT, an experimental SDS for obtaining train information over the phone. We then describe machine learning experiments based on these results that explore the predictive power of prosodic features alone and in combination with other automatically available information, including ASR confidence scores and recognized string. Our results indicate that there are significant prosodic differences between correctly and incorrectly recognized utterances. These differences can in fact be used to pre-",

Most approaches to deidentification rely heavily on dictionaries and heuristic rules; these approaches fail to remove most personal health information (PHI) that cannot be found in dictionaries. They also can fail to remove PHI that is ambiguous between PHI and non-PHI. Named entity recognition (NER) technologies can be used for deidentification. Some of these technologies exploit both local and global context of a word to identify its entity type. When documents are grammatically written, global context can improve NER. In this paper, we show that we can deidentify medical discharge summaries using support vector machines that rely on a statistical representation of local context. We compare our approach with three different systems. Comparison with a rulebased approach shows that a statistical representation of local context contributes more to deidentification than dictionaries and hand-tailored heuristics. Comparison with two well-known systems, SNoW and IdentiFinder, shows that when the language of documents is fragmented, local context contributes more to deidentification than global context.",

  "abstract": "It is practically impossible to build a word-based lexicon for speech recognition in agglutinative languages that would cover all the relevant words. The problem is that words are generally built by concatenating several prefixes and suffixes to the word roots. Together with compounding and inflections this leads to millions of different, but still frequent word forms. Due to inflections, ambiguity and other phenomena, it is also not trivial to automatically split the words into meaningful parts. Rule-based morphological analyzers can perform this splitting, but due to the handcrafted rules, they also suffer from an out-of-vocabulary problem. In this paper we apply a recently proposed fully automatic and rather language and vocabulary independent way to build subword lexica for three different agglutinative languages. We demonstrate the language portability as well by building a successful large vocabulary speech recognizer for each language and show superior recognition performance compared to the corresponding word-based reference systems.",

Standard word LMs suffer from high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates, whereas the morph LMs can recognize previously unseen word forms by concatenating morphs. We show that the morph LMs generally outperform the word LMs and that they perform fairly well on OOVs without compromising the accuracy obtained for in-vocabulary words.",

In addition, since PropBank was designed on a verb-by-verb basis, the argument labels Arg2 Arg5 get used for very diverse argument roles with inconsistent training instances. For example, the verb “make” uses Arg2 for the “Material” argument; but the verb “multiply” uses Arg2 for the “Extent” argument. As a result, it can be difficult for automatic classifiers to learn to distinguish arguments Arg2-Arg5. We have created a mapping between PropBank and VerbNet that provides a VerbNet thematic role label for each verb-specific PropBank label. Since VerbNet uses argument labels that are more consistent across verbs, we are able to demonstrate that these new labels are easier to learn.",

Since the method we used involves learning the morphological relationships between names and their transliterations, we refer to this IR-based approach as morphological query expansion for machine transliteration. The morphological query expansion approach is general in scope and can be applied to translation and transliteration, but we focus on transliteration in this paper. Many texts containing proper names (e.g., “The cities of Mesopotamia prospered under Parthian and Sassanian rule.”) are submitted to machine translation services on the Web every day, and there are also service on the Web specifically target transliteration of proper names, including CHINET (Kwok et al. 2005) ad Livetrans (Lu, Chien, and Lee 2004). Machine translation systems on the Web such as Yahoo Translate (babelfish.yahoo.com) and Google Translate (translate.google.com/translate_t.g) typically use a bilingual dictionary that is either manually compiled or learned from a parallel corpus. However, such dictionaries often have insufficient coverage of proper names and technical terms, leading to poor translation due to out of vocabulary problem. The OOV problems of machine translation or cross language information retrieval can be handled more effectively by learning to find transliteration on the Web. Consider Sentence 1 containing three place names. 1. The cities of Mesopotamia prospered under Parthian and Sassanian rule. 2. 城市繁榮下parthian 達米亞、sassanian統",

  "abstract": "Word sense disambiguation is the process of determining which sense of a word is used in a given context. Due to its importance in understanding semantics of natural languages, word sense disambiguation has been extensively studied in Computational Linguistics. However, existing methods either are brittle and narrowly focus on specific topics or words, or provide only mediocre performance in real-world settings. Broad coverage and disambiguation quality are critical for a word sense disambiguation system. In this paper we present a fully unsupervised word sense disambiguation method that requires only a dictionary and unannotated text as input. Such an automatic approach overcomes the problem of brittleness suffered in many existing methods and makes broad-coverage word sense disambiguation feasible in practice. We evaluated our approach using SemEval 2007 Task 7 (Coarse-grained English All-words Task), and our system significantly outperformed the best unsupervised system participating in SemEval 2007 and achieved the performance approaching top-performing supervised systems. Although our method was only tested with coarse-grained sense disambiguation, it can be directly applied to fine-grained sense disambiguation.",

We show that simple incremental post-processing can improve stability dramatically, at the cost of timeliness (from 90% of edits of hypotheses being spurious down to 10% at a lag of 320ms). The measures are not independent, and we show how system designers can find a desired operating point for their ASR.

By comparison, there is no significant gain when applying the same system to the English translations of the same texts/labels, emphasizing the need for subword modeling in many languages.

In accordance with popular wisdom, we find that it’s important to train on the same metric used in testing. However, we also find that training to a newer metric is only useful to the extent that the MT model’s structure and features allow it to take advantage of the metric. Contrasting with TER’s good correlation with human judgments, we show that people tend to prefer BLEU and NIST trained models to those trained on edit distance based metrics like TER or WER. Human preferences for METEOR trained models varies depending on the source language. Since using BLEU or NIST produces models that are more robust to evaluation by other metrics and perform well in human judgments, we conclude they are still the best choice for training.",

As an alternative to the log posterior representation used in their system, we explore frame-level representations derived from the CRF feature functions.

We report significant gains over the previous Crandem system on the Wall Street Journal word recognition task.",

  "abstract": "Many works (of both fiction and non-fiction) span multiple, intersecting narratives, each of which constitutes a story in its own right. In this work I introduce the task of multiple narrative disentanglement (MND), in which the aim is to tease these narratives apart by assigning passages from a text to the sub-narratives to which they belong. The motivating example I use is David Foster Wallace’s fictional text Infinite Jest. I selected this book because it contains multiple, interweaving narratives within its sprawling 1,000-plus pages. I propose and evaluate a novel unsupervised approach to MND that is motivated by the theory of narratology. This method achieves strong empirical results, successfully disentangling the threads in Infinite Jest and significantly outperforming baseline strategies in doing so.",

We propose to account for this in a simple modification of the windowDiff metric.

However, guided reading levels developed by educators operate at a more fine-grained level, with multiple levels corresponding to each grade. We find that ranking performs much better than classification at the fine-grained leveling task, and that features derived from the visual layout of a book are just as predictive as standard text features of level; including both sets of features, we find that we can predict the reading level up to 83% of the time on a small corpus of children’s books.",

We evaluate the approach under several scenarios, including both supervised and unsupervised training, the latter achieved by training on the output of a baseline automatic word-alignment model. We also adapt the ASR models to the domain, and evaluate the impact of error rate on performance. We find strong robustness to ASR errors, even using just the 1-best system output.

  "abstract": "Recent work has shown that word aligned data can be used to learn a model for reordering source sentences to match the target order. This model learns the cost of putting a word immediately before another word and finds the best reordering by solving an instance of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, for efficiently solving the TSP, the model is restricted to pairwise features which examine only a pair of words and their neighborhood. In this work, we go beyond these pairwise features and learn a model to rerank the n-best reorderings produced by the TSP model using higher order and structural features which help in capturing longer range dependencies. In addition to using a more informative set of source side features, we also capture target side features indirectly by using the translation score assigned to a reordering. Our experiments, involving Urdu-English, show that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-theart PBSMT system which uses the TSP model for reordering by 1.3 BLEU points, and a publicly available state-of-the-art MT system, Hiero, by 3 BLEU points.",

The reason is that messages on micro-blogs are short, noisy and informal texts with little context, and often contain phrases with ambiguous meanings. To rigorously address the Twitter entity linking problem, we propose a structural SVM algorithm for entity linking that jointly optimizes mention detection and entity disambiguation as a single end-to-end task.

The features in our model are inspired by OT’s Markedness and Faithfulness constraints. Following the OT principle that such features indicate “violations”, we require their weights to be non-positive. We apply our model to a modified version of the Buckeye corpus (Pitt et al., 2007) in which the only phonological alternations are deletions of word-final /d/ and /t/ segments. The model sets a new state-ofthe-art for this corpus for word segmentation, identification of underlying forms, and identification of /d/ and /t/ deletions. We also show that the OT-inspired sign constraints on feature weights are crucial for accurate identification of deleted /d/s; without them our model posits approximately 10 times more deleted underlying /d/s than appear in the manually annotated data.",

This paper investigates two ways of incorporating word embeddings in a word sense disambiguation setting and evaluates these two methods on some SensEval/SemEval lexical sample and all-words tasks and also a domain-specific lexical sample task. The obtained results show that such representations consistently improve the accuracy of the selected supervised WSD system.

We replicate the human evaluation component of WMT-13 and reveal that the current state-of-the-art performance of segment-level metrics is better than previously believed. Three segment-level metrics — METEOR, NLEPOR and SENTBLEUMOSES — are found to correlate with human assessment at a level not significantly outperformed by any other metric in both the individual language pair assessment for Spanish-toEnglish and the aggregated set of 9 language pairs.",

The field of WSD has found the MFS baseline very hard to beat. Clearly, if WSD researchers had access to MFS values, their striving to better this heuristic will push the WSD frontier. However, getting MFS values requires sense annotated corpus in enormous amounts, which is out of bounds for most languages, even if their WordNets are available. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for MFS detection from the untagged corpora, which exploits word embeddings. We compare the word embedding of a word with all its sense embeddings and obtain the predominant sense with the highest similarity. We observe significant performance gain for Hindi WSD over the WordNet First Sense (WFS) baseline. As for English, the SemCor baseline is bettered for those words whose frequency is greater than 2.

In this paper, we perform a pilot study to control honorifics in neural machine translation (NMT) via side constraints, focusing on English→German. We show that by marking up the (English) source side of the training data with a feature that encodes the use of honorifics on the (German) target side, we can control the honorifics produced at test time. Experiments show that the choice of honorifics has a big impact on translation quality as measured by BLEU, and oracle experiments show that substantial improvements are possible by constraining the translation to the desired level of politeness.",

This issue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the ‘Story Cloze Test’. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of 50k five-sentence commonsense stories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental evaluation shows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on shallow language understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story Cloze Test. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and offer suggestions for deeper language understanding.",

We find that different types of acoustic-prosodic features are individually helpful, and together give statistically significant improvements in parse and disfluency detection F1 scores over a strong text-only baseline.

Based on evaluation on discussions from the Change My View forum on Reddit, the two components work together to predict an OH's change in view, outperforming several baselines.

In this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing warrants systematically. We operationalize it in a scalable crowdsourcing process, resulting in a freely licensed dataset with warrants for 2k authentic arguments from news comments. On this basis, we present a new challenging task, the argument reasoning comprehension task. Given an argument with a claim and a premise, the goal is to choose the correct implicit warrant from two options. Both warrants are plausible and lexically close, but lead to contradicting claims.

Furthermore, a system that predicts only the object category given the input can achieve a precision of 84.2% in top-2 predictions.

We hypothesize that this encourages the models to learn characteristics for different publication sources (e.g., \"The Onion\" vs. \"The Guardian\") rather than characteristics of satire, leading to poor generalization performance to unseen publication sources. We therefore propose a novel model for satire detection with an adversarial component to control for the confounding variable of publication source. On a large novel data set collected from German news (which we make available to the research community), we observe comparable satire classification performance and, as desired, a considerable drop in publication classification performance with adversarial training. Our analysis shows that the adversarial component is crucial for the model to learn to pay attention to linguistic properties of satire.",

  "abstract": "Authors' keyphrases assigned to scientific articles are essential for recognizing content and topic aspects. Most of the proposed supervised and unsupervised methods for keyphrase generation are unable to produce terms that are valuable but do not appear in the text. In this paper, we explore the possibility of considering the keyphrase string as an abstractive summary of the title and the abstract. First, we collect, process and release a large dataset of scientific paper metadata that contains 2.2 million records. Then we experiment with popular text summarization neural architectures. Despite using advanced deep learning models, large quantities of data and many days of computation, our systematic evaluation on four test datasets reveals that the explored text summarization methods could not produce better keyphrases than the simpler unsupervised methods, or the existing supervised ones.",

GEC models have been previously evaluated based on a single commonly applied corpus: the CoNLL-2014 benchmark. However, the evaluation remains incomplete because the task difficulty varies depending on the test corpus and conditions such as the proficiency levels of the writers and essay topics. To overcome this limitation, we evaluate the performance of several GEC models, including NMT-based (LSTM, CNN, and transformer) and an SMT-based model, against various learner corpora (CoNLL-2013, CoNLL-2014, FCE, JFLEG, ICNALE, and KJ). Evaluation results reveal that the models' rankings considerably vary depending on the corpus, indicating that single-corpus evaluation is insufficient for GEC models.",

We investigate the impact of visual adversarial attacks on current NLP systems on character-, word-, and sentence-level tasks, showing that both neural and non-neural models are, in contrast to humans, extremely sensitive to such attacks, suffering performance decreases of up to 82%. We then explore three shielding methods-visual character embeddings, adversarial training, and rule-based recovery-which substantially improve the robustness of the models. However, the shielding methods still fall behind performances achieved in non-attack scenarios, which demonstrates the difficulty of dealing with visual attacks.",

Models are trained using teacher forcing to optimise only the one-step-ahead prediction. However, at test time, the model is asked to generate a whole sequence, causing errors to propagate through the generation process (exposure bias). A number of authors have suggested that optimising for rewards less tightly coupled to the training data might counter this mismatch. We therefore optimise directly for various objectives beyond simply replicating the ground truth questions, including a novel approach using an adversarial discriminator that seeks to generate questions that are indistinguishable from real examples. We confirm that training with policy gradient methods leads to increases in the metrics used as rewards. We perform a human evaluation, and show that although these metrics have previously been assumed to be good proxies for question quality, they are poorly aligned with human judgement and the model simply learns to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source.",

Grounding generally requires reference labeled data, a luxury a low-resource language might not have. In this work, we describe an approach for low-resource unsupervised POS tagging that yields fully grounded output and requires no labeled training data. We find the classic method of Brown et al. (1992) clusters well in our use case and employ a decipherment-based approach to grounding. This approach presumes a sequence of cluster IDs is a 'ciphertext' and seeks a POS tag-to-cluster ID mapping that will reveal the POS sequence. We show intrinsically that, despite the difficulty of the task, we obtain reasonable performance across a variety of languages. We also show extrinsically that incorporating our POS tagger into a name tagger leads to state-of-the-art tagging performance in Sinhalese and Kinyarwanda, two languages with nearly no labeled POS data available. We further demonstrate our tagger's utility by incorporating it into a true 'zero-resource' variant of the MALOPA (Ammar et al., 2016) dependency parser model that removes the current reliance on multilingual resources and gold POS tags for new languages. Experiments show that including our tagger makes up much of the accuracy lost when gold POS tags are unavailable.",

This is based on the basic information in the SDP enhanced with information selected by several attention mechanisms with kernel filters, namely RbSP (Richer-but-Smarter SDP).

In this paper, we address this challenge by using a reinforcement-learning-based generator-evaluator architecture. Our generator employs an attention-based encoder-decoder to transfer a sentence from the source style to the target style. Our evaluator is an adversarially trained style discriminator with semantic and syntactic constraints that score the generated sentence for style, meaning preservation, and fluency. Experimental results on two different style transfer tasks-sentiment transfer, and formality transfer-show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.Furthermore, we perform a manual evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method using subjective metrics of generated text quality.",

In this paper we analyze the behavior of two recently proposed entity-centric models in a referential task, Entity Linking in Multi-party Dialogue (SemEval 2018 Task 4). We show that these models outperform the state of the art on this task, and that they do better on lower frequency entities than a counterpart model that is not entity-centric, with the same model size. We argue that making models entity-centric naturally fosters good architectural decisions. However, we also show that these models do not really build entity representations and that they make poor use of linguistic context.

In the general case, however, we believe that it is possible to combine visual and textual information in order to ground translations. In this paper we probe the contribution of the visual modality to state-of-the-art MMT models by conducting a systematic analysis where we partially deprive the models from source-side textual context. Our results show that under limited textual context, models are capable of leveraging the visual input to generate better translations. This contradicts the current belief that MMT models disregard the visual modality because of either the quality of the image features or the way they are integrated into the model.",

Also verbs may be translated differently (i.e. have a different sense) according to the semantic space in which they occur. For instance, English warming up translates into erhitzen in a more general sense, but into aufwiinnen in the sports domain. Because of the apparent relevance then of domains or topics on sense disambiguation, a panel was organized at SENSEV AL-2 to discuss some current and previous work in this area.

  "abstract": "Object recognition is a little like translation: a picture (text in a source language) goes in, and a description (text in a target language) comes out. I will use this analogy, which has proven fertile, to describe recent progress in object recognition. We have very good methods to spot some objects in images, but extending these methods to produce descriptions of images remains very difficult. The description might come in the form of a set of words, indicating objects, and boxes or regions spanned by the object. This representation is difficult to work with, because some objects seem to be much more important than others, and because objects interact. An alternative is a sentence or a paragraph describing the picture, and recent work indicates how one might generate rich structures like this. Furthermore, recent work suggests that it is easier and more effective to generate descriptions of images in terms of chunks of meaning (”person on a horse”) rather than just objects (”person”; ”horse”). Finally, if the picture contains objects that are unfamiliar, then we need to generate useful descriptions that will make it possible to interact with them, even though we don’t know what they are.

  "year": 2015,
  "venue": "SemEval",
  "abstract": "Task 18 at SemEval 2015 defines BroadCoverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicate–argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning. In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other language analysis sub-tasks, introduce and compare the semantic dependency target representations used, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results. 1 Background and Motivation Syntactic dependency parsing has seen great advances in the past decade, but tree-oriented parsers are ill-suited for producing meaning representations, i.e. moving from the analysis of grammatical structure to sentence semantics. Even if syntactic parsing arguably can be limited to tree structures, this is not the case in semantic analysis, where a node will often be the argument of multiple predicates (i.e. have more than one incoming arc), and it will often be desirable to leave nodes corresponding to semantically vacuous word classes unattached (with no incoming arcs). Thus, Task 18 at SemEval 2015, Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP 2015),1 seeks to stimulate the parsing community to move towards See http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/ task18/ for further technical details, information on how to obtain the data, and official results. more general graph processing, to thus enable a more direct analysis of Who did What to Whom? Extending the very similar predecessor task SDP 2014 (Oepen et al., 2014), we make use of three distinct, parallel semantic annotations over the same common texts, viz. the venerable Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Brown segments of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993) for English, as well as comparable resources for Chinese and Czech. Figure 1 below shows example target representations, bi-lexical semantic dependency graphs in all cases, for the WSJ sentence: (1) A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans, and rice. Semantically, technique arguably is dependent on the determiner (the quantificational locus), the modifier similar, and the predicate apply. Conversely, the predicative copula, infinitival to, and the vacuous preposition marking the deep object of apply can be argued to not have a semantic contribution of their own. Besides calling for node re-entrancies and partial connectivity, semantic dependency graphs may also exhibit higher degrees of non-projectivity than is typical of syntactic dependency trees. Besides its relation to syntactic dependency parsing, the task also has some overlap with Semantic Role Labeling (SRL; Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002).2 However, we require parsers to identify ‘fullIn much previous SRL work, target representations typically draw on resources like PropBank and NomBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004), which are limited to argument identification and labeling for verbal and nominal predicates.

More hyperparameters trivially lead to potential performance gains, but what do they actually do to improve the models? Are individual hyperparameters’ contributions independent of each other? Or are only specific parameter combinations beneficial? To answer these questions, we perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of major hyperparameters as identified in previous research.",

  "abstract": "This paper describes our system partici- pated in Task 9 of SemEval-2019: the task is focused on suggestion mining and it aims to classify given sentences into sug- gestion and non-suggestion classes in do- main specific and cross domain training setting respectively. We propose a multi- perspective architecture for learning rep- resentations by using different classical models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Feed Forward Attention (FFA), etc. To leverage the semantics distributed in large amount of unsupervised data, we also have adopted the pre-trained Bidi- rectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model as an en- coder to produce sentence and word rep- resentations. The proposed architecture is applied for both sub-tasks, and achieved f1-score of 0.7812 for subtask A, and 0.8579 for subtask B. We won the first and second place for the two tasks respec- tively in the final competition.",

  "year": 2019,
  "venue": "SemEval",
  "abstract": "In this paper we describe a deep-learning system that competed as SemEval 2019 Task 9-SubTask A: Suggestion Mining from Online Reviews and Forums. We use Word2Vec to learn the distributed representations from sentences. This system is composed of a Stacked Bidirectional Long-Short Memory Network (SBiLSTM) for enriching word representations before and after the sequence relationship with context. We perform an ensemble to improve the effectiveness of our model. Our official submission results achieve an F1-score 0.5659.",
