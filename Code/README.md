We tested the code using Python 3.10.6. The required libraries are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).


## Code to apply the model
You can apply a model of your choice to a dataset of your choice by changing the confiugration in line 6-9:
```python
# Configuration
model_file = r'../Model/analysis-model.h5'
data_file = r'../Data/Datasets/NLP.json'
output_file = r'NLP-Predictions.json'
```
Make sure to use the [`analysis-model.h5`](/Model/analysis-model.h5) file (~420MB) and not the pointer file with the same name (~1KB).


## Code to train the model
You can train a model on a dataset of your choice by changing the train and dev datasets in line 14-16:
```python
# File Configuration
train_file = r'../Data/Human Annotated Data/NLP.json'
dev_file = r'../Data/Human Annotated Data/ML.json'
```

You can also specify the hyperparameters to use by modifying the dict in line 19-24 and you can set the number of models to train for each combination of hyperparameters in line 25:
```python
# Hyperparameter Configuration
hyperparameters = {
	'batch_size': [16],
	'epochs': [3],
	'learning_rate': [5e-5],
	'warmup_ratio': [0.06],
}
executions_per_trial = 10
```

The following keys in the `hyperparameters` dict can be set to a list of values to try:

| Hyperparameter  | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `batch_size`    | number of samples per gradient update, passed to [Model.fit(...)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit)                    |

| `warmup_ratio`  | fraction of iterations the slanted triangular learning rate increases                                                                               |
| `weight_decay`  | weight decay, passed to [AdamW(...)](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/optimizers/AdamW)                                        |

After running the script the following contents will be in a subfolder of the `TrainModel` folder:

| File                      | Description                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `best-model.h5`           | weights of the best model based on the MSE on the dev set (you can use the weights with the [code to apply the model](MakePredictions.py)) |
